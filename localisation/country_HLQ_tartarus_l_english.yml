tartarus_hellquill.11.t:0 "Southern Opportunity" #HLQ
tartarus_hellquill.11.d:0 "Lushi is backward, poor nation still deeply in past of feudalism in serfdom. However in comparision to their neighbours they are at least relatively stable (not that it is an achievement if we compare them to bandit infested mountains, bandit infested plains and commies infested ricefields…). Still, they are in state permanent danger of being attacked and in desperate need for an ally, and nobles can be swayed to our cause by either bribery or blackmailing them, while propaganda action can sway commoners to our cause. Hopefully our sympathisers in princely court will keep him unaware of our plot until it is too late… And until we will be ready to send him proposition he could not reject."
tartarus_hellquill.11.a:0 "Initiate Fall Grun."

tartarus_hellquill.1.t:0 "A Proposition" #LUS
tartarus_hellquill.1.d:0 "Somethings been wrong for last days – apparently some reports seemed to be missing, and courtiers were kind of… nervous. Now, problem revealed itself – group of nobles approached the prince praising Wingfried von Katerinburg and his Reformisten ideology and suggesting forming an alliance with them – surely they could assist us with modernizing state and defend us from numerous enemies. Not long after this, we received letter from Wingfried with proposition of “creating stronger ties” between our states and invitation to Hellquil to discuss future relations between Lushi and Hellquil. It seems like an obvious trap… But are we really in position to refuse?"
tartarus_hellquill.1.a:0 "We are not..."
tartarus_hellquill.1.b:0 "WE ARE! Call the knights!"

tartarus_hellquill.2.t:0 "Fate of Lushi" #LUS
tartarus_hellquill.2.d:0 "Prince of Lushi arrived to Hellquil and is now in our claws. It is now to us, to decide fate of him, and his country. We have gained enough support among nobility and commoners alike to swiftly take power in Lushi and integrate it in Hellquil – however it may be more beneficial to leave prince in charge of country as our “ally” – as griffons surely will be more willing to follow him, than some foreigners. Of course we will send advisors that will help prince in governing country in a way that will benefit both Hellquil and Lushi."
tartarus_hellquill.2.a:0 "Bring Lushi into the fold."
tartarus_hellquill.2.b:0 "An “Alliance” with Lushi will suffice."

tartarus_hellquill.3.t:0 "Brave or Stupid?" #LUS
tartarus_hellquill.3.d:0 "The Prince of Lushi foolishly rejected our generous proposition of alliance. Griffons of Lushi cannot be aloud to stay under power of such reckless ruler... They will surely happily welcome our soldiers and later join Reformisten cause. We can only mourn that we are forced to spill fellow griffon's blood."
tartarus_hellquill.3.a:0 "War it is, then."
tartarus_hellquill.3.b:0 "We'll deal with them in a moment."

tartarus_hellquill.12.t:0 "Eastward Movement" #GRY
tartarus_hellquill.12.d:0 "After Lushi would be under Hellquill, looking to the East would seem like an opportunity. Although they were comprised of tribes, the Gryphian Host were still far more stable than any bandit country. However, despite this, Prywhen’s influence to them would put them in a state of conflict against each other. With what Nobles were there, we could potentially get them to be “convinced” and therefore use them to convert others to our ideals."
tartarus_hellquill.12.a:0 "Onwards, then."

tartarus_hellquill.4.t:0 "More Problems..." #GRY
tartarus_hellquill.4.d:0 "Unrest has become common throughout, however the source of it seems to start from the tribes. The Nobles have come up with a few ideas on what to do, and how to treat the situation, some spouting about “an alliance.” Hell, some have even convinced some tribes to such the idea of such Alliance, but with who? That answer would come soon, as a message from a Noble came bearing praise to that of Wingfriend and this “ideology” of Hellquill. We could follow what the Nobles are saying, or we could refuse and send the Nobles away."
tartarus_hellquill.4.a:0 "Perhaps this is for the best..."
tartarus_hellquill.4.b:0 "O king, Hellquillian demon and damned Maar's kith and kin..."

tartarus_hellquill.5.t:0 "Fate of Gryphian Hosts" #GRY
tartarus_hellquill.5.d:0 "With the acceptance of our alliance, we can now decide if we wish to fully integrate the lands, or take them in as an ally, as it may prove beneficial to us. If we decide to keep them as an ally, we shall place an advisor there to help govern the lands in a way to benefit each other properly."
tartarus_hellquill.5.a:0 "Integrate them."

tartarus_hellquill.6.t:0 "A Bold Move." #GRY
tartarus_hellquill.6.d:0 "We have recieved a letter in response from the Gryphian Cossack, which will not be repeated aloud due to the intense severity of its contents. Suffice it to say, the Cossacks have refused our generous offer while simultaneously causing any civil griffon to cry from the sheer rudeness contained in the letter. This insult cannot go unpunished, and stability will be brought to Gryphia."
tartarus_hellquill.6.a:0 "Time for War."

tartarus_hellquill.7.t:0 "They come."
tartarus_hellquill.7.d:0 "The hall is quiet. In the center stands a large table, and on it is pinned a map. On one side, officers dressed in County Defense Force uniforms, either too young or too old, nervous in apprehension but firm in their resolve. On the other, griffins in the black of the Reformisten, stoic and grim-faced.  On one end of the table is King Wingfried, a mysterious black Unicorn and a brown griffon with glasses a scarred beak at his side.  At the other, having just spoken, the Countess.\n\n"The bulls are coming. They're either upon our shores already, or sailing across as we speak."\n\n"You think they can make landfall that easy?" Wingfried asks quietly. The officers remain silent. Monarchs are speaking.\n\n"We've done our best to suppress the indogenes," Sumpfkiel responds, studying the map of Cyanolisia and her neighbor Asterion. "Regardless, they will have supporters. Some will slip through, signal them to safe beaches. Shelter them in the night."\n\n"Then we are at war," Wingfried stated plainly, examining the map himself.\n\n"We always knew it would come."\n\n"At least we are prepared. My troops stand beside yours, ready to meet the enemy on the beach."\n\n"Until the end?" She asked, a small smile on her beak.\n\nAcross from her, Wingfried remained stoic. Unmoving. But, to the careful observer, his face twitched around his mouth.\n\n"Until the end," he agreed.\n\nIt was time to see to the defense. The best laid plans had been prepared. Their soldiers and knights were as ready as could be.\n\nIt was time to decide Cyanolisia's fate."
tartarus_hellquill.7.a:0 "We shall win."

tartarus_hellquill.8.t:0 "On The Steps"
tartarus_hellquill.8.d:0 "The Cyanolisian parliament building in Thymíaustadt still bore the architectural influences of the minotaurs who first built the city.  However much it had been griffonized, under the brick and mortar were still sweeping marble columns and stone plazas, and Wingfried had to hold back a sneer as he and Erich ascended the steps.\n\n“Deplorable,” he muttered, shaking his head as he passed the few County Defense Force soldiers at the entrance, their old rifles barely held with confidence.  “On the verge of annihilation, with griffon culture mutilated like so...perhaps it is too late we are here.”\n\n“It can never be too late, Father,” Erich replied, his horn glowing as he pushed the doors open for them into the empty lobby, the Reformistan officers in their black uniforms following close behind wordlessly.  “You always taught me the Griffonian legacy would remain.  But if it is too far gone...we can always burn the city down and start a new one.”\n\n“Yes...let’s save that for our last resort, shall we?” Wingfried muttered.  The doors to the Parliament chamber were guarded by more CDF soldiers, and at least these looked more professional.  The messenger leading them stepped inside, flaring his wings to gather attention before rising and declaring “Presenting! His Highness, King Wingfried of Hellquill!  Requesting audience with the Countess and her advisors!”"
tartarus_hellquill.8.a:0 "As expected."

tartarus_hellquill.9.t:0 "The Countess"
tartarus_hellquill.9.d:0 "“Your Grace,” he started, bowing his head slightly.  Across from him, the Countess dipped her head as well.  “Your Highness,” she returned.  “Why have you come so far south?”\n\n“I am here, My Lady, because you and everygriff here is in grave danger.”\n\n“I wonder how you came to this discovery, My Lord,” Taillow quipped, drudging a chuckle or two from her Parliament.  Wingfried, thrown for a moment, managed to retain his stoicism and continued on.\n\n“The minotaurs of Asterion stand ready to unite their disparate tribes and attack you. With the help of their countryfolk here on the mainland, your destruction is assured.”\n\n“You’re not telling us anything we’re not aware of, Herr King,” piped up Field Marshal Vogelbeck from the side.  “We know our dire straits.  If that’s all you have to say, I’m afraid you’ve wasted a trip.”\n\n“Would it be a waste for me to offer my assistance?”  Wingfried gestured to the chamber at large, staring directly at the Countess.  “You all seem to know my reputation.  And that of the Reformistan.  You stand to be crushed, and you lack the soldiers and material to hold.  Your ships are few, your ammunition stores are limited and even if you make an attempt to step onto Asterion, their overwhelming numbers will ensure your annihilation.  And let’s not talk about the West.”\n\nThe Countess glared back at him, her eyes full of defiance.  Wingfried approved.  She had fire after all.  Perhaps there was hope.\n\n“I have no interest in submitting my County from a fate of dominance by bovines to dominance by Reformistan thugs, King Wingfried.  If you’re offering to become our warlord saviour in exchange for us honoring you as our sovereign, I’m afraid I’m not so desperate to seek your assistance.”\n\n“Even if it means sacrificing your culture?” Wingfried shot back.  “Your freedom?  Your lives, perhaps?  Will you not exercise every possible means of resisting?”\n\n“Make a deal with you?  You mean like Brodfeld did with Blackrock?” she shot back.  “I have no interest in raising your banner, Your Highness.”\n\nWhile she had spine after all, he had to wince at her stubbornness.  Time for a new tactic.  If she would not bow to reason, perhaps a little evidence and counter offer would help.\n\n“I’m not here for your land, Countess.  As I’m sure you might be able to discern from my victories in Longsword and Blackrock, I am a protector of Griffonian culture.  I stand to destroy those who threaten order, and ensure all of griffonkind has a place of safety in the world.”\n\n“So you’re an idealogue,” she scoffed.  “So are the GLA.”\n\n“If you ask that I go, after all this, I’ll take my knights and go back north.” Wingfried fixed her gaze solemnly.  “But if you let me stay, not only will I ensure your safety from the threat to east and west, I will help raise Cyanolisia to a greatness she hasn’t been at since the days of the Old Empire.  And I will turn over every scrap of land to you.”  He leaned forward, talons digging into the podium. “Now...do I have your interest, Countess?”\n\nThe parliament chamber once again began to buzz, but Countess Taillow stayed silent, holding his gaze, clearly pondering his offer in her head as her talons tapped on the wood in front of her, considering.  There was more to this woman than he’d previously thought, and Wingfried was suddenly intrigued on a level he hadn’t been in quite some time.  Privately, he hoped she’d say yes for more reasons than he was willing to admit.\n\n“Fine,” she finally stated.  “Come with me. We’ll start drawing up the treaty.”"
tartarus_hellquill.9.a:0 "The negotiations were short"

tartarus_hellquill.10.t:0 "The Treaty"
tartarus_hellquill.10.d:0 "“Is this it, then?”\n\nWingfried raised an eyebrow, examining the culmination of the defensive agreement. So much time spent on a piece of paper, all of it over a single sheet. He must find the clerk who finalized this and promote that griff.\n\n“There in black ink,” Countess Taillow replied, extending a quill. “Now we sign in front of witnesses.”\n\nThe ‘witnesses’ in question were Erich and Eisen, clad in full Reformistan dress wear, Yohn Vogelbeck in his field marshal’s uniform and several County Knights, standing quiet and stoic off in the corners of the chamber. This location has been specifically chosen, away from the prying eyes of the Defense Force, the Hellquill officers and Parliament. Just the trusted few here to witness this historic event.\n\nWingfried took the quill, dipping it in a nearby inkwell and signing it without ceremony.\n\n“You’re doing the right thing, My Lady,” he said, turning the sheet around and handing both it and the quill over. Taillow took them with her own raised eyebrow, studying him a moment. Being so scrutinized by such a stern and powerful woman, Wingfried felt temporarily put on the spot.\n\n“We’ll see about that, won’t we?” She mused, turning to sign the treaty herself.\n\nAbruptly, something cracked on the outside of the chamber, and all parties stiffened, suddenly aware and at attention, trying to hear for it again. But instead, the wall suddenly blew inwards with a boom, rocking the building and blowing two knights into meaty gore.\n\nCoughing, trying to see what was happening and scrambling for his sidearm, Wingfried called out “Eisen! Erich!”\n\n“Here, my king!” came his general’s reply, and the glow through the dust told him Erich was likely digging himself out from the rubble as well.\n\nThey had no time to rest, however. Another Knight, sword drawn and attempting to find his Countess, was abruptly crushed by a dark shape in the dust. Enchanted plate or no, the Knight was helpless as a revolver fired into his bare face.\n\n“To arms!” cried Vogelbeck, stumbling towards the door. “Guards! We’re under attack!”\n\nIndeed they were. First one, then two, three, more. Hulking in the bright light, silent in the dust, the minotaurs moved far swifter than their frames suggested. Another Knight drew his sword and cut two assailants down before himself being crushed by a thrown hunk of stone the size of a small car. But these were no Asterionese commandos. Their gear was old, they wore no armor. Indogenes were capable of this kind of daring?\n\n“Kill them all!” Wingfried cried, firing his pistol at the nearest form.\n\nThe fight could only have lasted a minute, but to Wingfried it felt like at least a day of shooting, stabbing, dodging blow and bulllets and stones. He, Eisen and Erich were backed into the far corner, pistols snapping and magic flying as they beat back the assassins. Nearby, the last Knight was hefted up, her head abruptly ripped off by Minotaur might. Stoic, unflappable King that he was, Wingfried finally felt a small twinge of fear.\n\nA pistol exploded nearby, and a string of words sputtered out near him. Whirling, he came face to face with the bleeding maw of another Minotaur, one who had snuck up on the three while they were distracted. Now, bleeding from the bullet hole in his face, the attacker crumpled in a heap.\n\n“Good shot, Eisen,” he muttered, checking his own weapon. \n\n“Not me, sir.” the general replied quietly. “I was reloading.”\n\n“Then who-“\n\nWingfried yanked his head around as he finally saw her in the dust. Standing regally, a Knight’s pistol in hand and bleeding from a wound on her head, the Countess look fierce and beautiful both, her face screwed up as she favored her other claw.\n\n“Aren’t -you- supposed to be saving -me-?” She snapped.\n\nBefore he could answer her, the doors flew open again, and Vogelbeck returned, leading the charge of CDF troops, Knights and Hellquillian grenadiers, all loaded for bear and ready for a fight. With this kind of arsenal, it was little wonder the last two assassins didn’t fall to pieces under the weight of fire.\n\nBut as they were attended to by medics, Wingfried couldn’t take his eyes off Countess Taillow as, bandaged and fussed over, she managed to lean over and sign the treaty, then turn back and begin barking off orders."

tartarus_hellquill.13.t:0 "The Southern Towns" #GRU
tartarus_hellquill.13.d:0 "Free Cities of Gryphus for generations were hub of southern trade. Due to perpetual state of warfare on old eastern border of Griffonian Empire, Gryphusians established themselves as one of main directions of trade with Riverlands. If we want to secure our southern flank and open new front in upcoming conflict with eastern ponies, it is crucial to ensure that Free Cities are under our control. As we became major power in Eastern Griffonia, it is doubtful that fat and weak merchants of Gryphus will be willing to oppose us – especially if we promise them access to markets of our growing stare. And if they will be stupid stupid… Well, panzers solved every our problem so far, haven’t they?"
tartarus_hellquill.13.a:0 "Send an envoy!"

tartarus_hellquill.14.t:0 "Envoy From Hellquill"
tartarus_hellquill.14.d:0 "In recent years Reformisten of Hellquil marched through eastern Griffonia forcing its nations into submission via threats or force. Now, they are at our doorstep... And Wingfried, Arantigos of the East, turned his eyes on Gryphus. We just received letter in which he “suggested” that Free Towns should accept Hellquil protection... There were no further details but considering fate of other nations at best we can expect becoming their puppet – at worse becoming another province of Hellquil. It is darkest hour of Gryphus, and many suggest we should just surrender and continue making business, while not bothering any longer with politics."
tartarus_hellquill.14.a:0 "Make money, not war..."
tartarus_hellquill.14.b:0 "We will defend Gryphus till bitter end!"

tartarus_hellquill.15.t:0 "Gryphus Submits!"
tartarus_hellquill.15.d:0 "We just received news, that Free Cities decided to accept our protection and proposition of alliance. First Reformisten divisions are already crossing the border to occupy key cities and prepare to establish new order in Gryphus. Now, when south-east is under our control we must decide about its faith. We could annex Gryphus, turning into our new province and thus getting naval base on southern waters... However, Gryphus is home to old brothers in arms of Hellswordian knights – Order of Opinicus. Some suggest we should put them in charge of Gryphus and provide with autonomy to enforce our reign in this region. They are a bit... overzealous, but we believe that this agreement will benefit both sides..."
tartarus_hellquill.15.a:0 "Annex Gryphus!"
tartarus_hellquill.15.b:0 "Let knights rule Gryphus."

tartarus_hellquill.15.t:0 "Gryphus Refused!"
tartarus_hellquill.15.d:0 "Apparently we underestimated Gryphusians – they outright refused our generous offer and stated, that Gryphus will never give up its freedom. Altough their bravery is kind of touching, strategic importance of Free Cities is too important that we let them simply stay independent. Oberkommando predicts that war will be quick tough, and hopefully we will be able to minimize damage to key cities and industrial facilities..."
tartarus_hellquill.15.a:0 "Initiate Fall Weiss!"
tartarus_hellquill.15.b:0 "They're Next..."

tartarus_hellquill.17.t:0 "A Message From The North" #CYA
tartarus_hellquill.17.d:0 "Asterion is nothing if not persistent. As minotaur troops boil across our beaches, the County’s defense fights on as hard as it can. But the situation is bleak, and the fight ahead is still long. Then, a missive from the north.  A messenger in a black uniform, sporting the sigils of the Reformistan, flies up to the Countess’ castle, bearing a message; Wingfried has offered his assistance. Cheers arise from the beleaguered County kommandants, all but one. Countess Taillow Sumpfkiel reads the missive and feels a stir of uneasiness in her gizzard."
tartarus_hellquill.17.a:0 "Another warlord..."

tartarus_hellquill.18.t:0 "Aster’s Landing"
tartarus_hellquill.18.d:0 "“It is a beautiful sight.”\n\n“I suppose.”\n\nKing Wingfried shuffled uncomfortably, gazing out over the bay. Aster’s Landing was possibly the grandest city the minotaurs had, all marble columns and stone boulevards, sweeping murals and amazing works of art inside their temples and public buildings.  Even common shacks were of good make, sturdy and built with care. Another point of example for creatures with hands, he thought. Natural tool use, as opposed to magic adaptation, meant every creature capable of these works.\n\nIt was a shame, therefore, he would be instrumental in stripping this from these minotaurs.\n\nHe looked to the Countess, who leaned on the balcony, examining the city with a small, unidentifiable smile on her beak.  Over the time they’d worked together, he’d learned to read her expressions and body languages.  And right now, he could see, a great deal of weight and tension had been lifted from her wings.  Her gun sat on the balcony next to her as she watched Hellquillian grenadiers and County knights patrolling and securing the city.  The Asterionese they mostly ignored, the crowds moving carefully from home to market under the eye of Griffonian soldiers.  The fighting bulls had been pushed out already, off away into the countryside long ago, and resistance in the city had been stamped out.  If it wasn’t completely safe, he would not have risked bringing her here.  And not just out of a need to protect a fellow sovereign.  If anything had happened to her, he wasn’t entirely sure what he’d do...\n\nHe shook himself, moving to stand next to her as they looked out over the grand boulevard towards the open forum, and from there the harbor and then the sea itself. Far, far off in the distance, one could almost see the coastline of Cyanolisia again.  So close, it seemed, and yet for so long it was impossible to cross that gap.\n\n“He’d be proud,” Wingfried muttered, startling Taillow as she spun around, frowning deeply.  “Your husband, the Count,” he specified.  She went rigid, watching him carefully before she turned back, letting out a deep breath she was unlikely to realize she’d been holding.\n\n“My husband, Eyr bless his soul, was a loyal Imperial servant.  He knew how much a war would cost our people.”  She shook her head.  “I do not know how he would have felt to be here.  Just that he would have wanted to avoid it.”  She glanced back at the king beside her. “We could not have done this without you.”\n\n“No,” he said bluntly, for he knew it to be the truth.  “But the Reformisten came regardless.”\n\n“Not them,” she snorted, waving a claw at the city.  “The Black Cloaks are meaningless in this. I meant you, Wingfried. You’re a hero to the County.”\n\n“I am just here to protect griffonkind.  Nothing more.”\n\n“Oh?  Nothing more?  What a disappointment.”\n\nShe turned back, and he felt a small twinge in his gullet, causing him to shift uncomfortably. Finally, he said something out loud he had not even managed to admit to himself yet.\n\n“Well... and you.”\n\nShe looked back at him, a knowing smirk on her beak, and he felt his gaze flatten. She already knew. Of course she did.\n\nBut the Countess reached out, taking his claw in her own and squeezing lightly.\n\n“Then, I thank you.  For if you had not come, we would not be here.  In all ways.”\n\nIt was at this moment that Wingfried, alone with the Countess and atop the symbol of their near victory, smiled.  Together, they looked out over the city as the sunset painted beautiful mosaics with the columns, shadows and torches, watching the scenery for hours until the night sky rose instead.\n\nHe did not take his claw away."
tartarus_hellquill.18.a:0 "We have already won."

tartarus_hellquill.19.t:0 "The Proposal"
tartarus_hellquill.19.d:0 "It had certainly been long coming. The streets of Thymiaustadt were alive with cheers as the lines of County Defense Force troopers returned home, marching with their spirits now truly lifted.  The war was over.  Asterion, subdued.  Their genuine enthusiasm made up for their lack of discipline, as most of them were conscripts on the way home now the fight was done.  Behind them came the sailors, who were lined into more organized lines, faces grim and weapons shouldered.  And at the back came the Knights, both Hellquill and Cyanolisian, enchanted plate glistening in the bright sunlight as they held their swords aloft, beaked obscured by tournament helmets.  The crowd of griffons were screaming as they welcomed their protectors home, thankful the long struggle was finally over.  There were even a few minotaurs in the crowd, awkwardly clapping and quietly standing in a small clump of their own.\n\nFrom here, looking out from the palace balcony full of dignitaries, generals, members of parliament and important nobles, Countess Taillow Sumpfkiel finally laughed.  Finally smiled, with all the honesty that such an event would bring to her. The struggle was done, and her grief and worry could finally be laid to rest.  To her, this was the most beautiful sight in all of Griffonia.\n\nAnd to King Wingfried von Katerinburg, next to her, the sight of the Countess so happy was the most beautiful thing to him.\n\nHe looked over to Erich, standing always at the back, out of the spotlight. The unicorn gave his adopted father a meaningful glance before, with a nod, he turned to the door, returning a moment later with a small box held in his magic aura, which he quickly levitated to the king. Wingfried took it in one talon, checked the contents one last time, then returned to the Countess’ side."
tartarus_hellquill.19.a:0 "Ok."

tartarus_hellquill.20.t:0 "The Proposal"
tartarus_hellquill.20.d:0 "“My Lady,” he began, taking her attention from the victory parade. “These past few months we have stood side by side, I have felt you rise with me as no other has. You are incredibly brave, determined and idealistic, just like me. But you are also compassionate, insightful and very beautiful.”\n\nShe blinked, incredibly taken aback but saying nothing to stop him. He pressed on.\n\n“I know I am not the easiest griff to get to understand, or to cooperate with. Yet, believe me when I say the things my emotions will not allow me to express. You have taken root in my heart, My Lady. And I fear you shall never leave it.” He took her claw in his, kneeling down and producing the small box, flicking it open. “But you have opened a certain part of me, and without you, I feel I shall never be whole again. Marry me, My Lady. So I never lose you.”\n\nThe box within held a ring set with a diamond, a diamond from the mountains of Brantbeak that he had spared no expense or effort to acquire. Rare as her beauty was.  He offered it out to her, feeling his iron will peel back for a shred of a moment as he awaited her answer, that brief thrill of dread and excitement he hadn’t felt in some time.\n\nHe practically fainted as she slowly reached out and took the ring, smiling down at him. He had never felt such relief.\n\n“Well, when you put it that way, Your Highness,” She said, sliding the ring onto one finger, because of course she did things her own way. It was one of the reasons he loved her so.\n\nWingfried stood, taking her claws in his. The whole affair had been so quick and quiet, so personal up here that even her generals and ministers hadn’t seen what had happened.  But the crowd had. The people knew.\n\nWingfried has come south for ideology. But he had found so much more to fight for. Now, Cyanolisia would always be a part of him. So long as she stood by his side."
