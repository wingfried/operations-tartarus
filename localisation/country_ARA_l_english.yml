ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "From the stronghold of Romau to the city of Midoria, and from the boulevards of Aquileia to the ricefields of Sydia, stretched Arantigos' empire. Arantigos 'the Great' they called him, for he never lost a single battle. Alas, he taken too soon, and his empire collapsed with death. Now, all that remains of his legacy is the Barony of Arantiga. With Arantiga in a state of decay, a young, fanatic army general sees himself as the only hope for his beleagured nation. He will do whatever it takes to restore the glory of Arantiga, no matter the cost."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_408:0 "§YSparleto§!, and its sister cities of §YPonteles§! and §YAlbuvira§!, are steeped in history. One of the oldest cities in Griffonia, §YSparleto§! dates back thousands of years, before Griffenheim, before Grover, before even Equestria and her Princesses. The only record that exists of its founding lies in the story of the legendary king §YSparlos§!, first ruler of §YArantiga§!. According to legend, §YSparlos§! was exiled from his father's kingdom for attempted §Rfratricide§!, and sought to found his own realm. It is said he met §GBoreas§! himself atop the holy mountain of §YSolarspike§!, where he instructed Sparlos to throw his sword as far as he could, and where it landed, he would found a mighty city. And §YSparlos§! did so, throwing his sword west, into the setting sun. §YSparlos§! and his followers spent weeks searching for the sword, until at last §YSparlos§! found his sword lying on the shores of §YLake Rumare§!, near a quaint fishing village. And so, §YSparlos§! and his followers §Gfounded§! §YSparleto§!, and after many §Rhardships§! and §Rwars§! with mortals, monsters, and supernatural creatures, §YSparlos§! carved out his new §Grealm§!.\n\nThe next hundred or so generations of kings were simply mediocre, gradually expanding §YArantiga§!'s influence and bringing §Gprosperity§! to §YSparleto§! after dozens of §Rwars§! and §Ytreaties§!. And then came §YArantigos§!. His §Rconquests§! put §YSparleto§! on the map as the §Gcapital§! of his vast empire, which stretched from §YRomau§! to §YMidoria§!. §YSparleto§! quickly became a §Gbeacon of prosperity§! and a §Gcenter of learning§!, but this security was to be §Rshort-lived§!. Fate was cruel, and §YArantigos§! died as quickly as his empire rose. His §Ygenerals§! partioned his empire between them, but they quickly perished, falling prey to in-fighting and petty rivalries. And with them, §YSparleto§! fell into a §Rdark age§! of obscurity and poverty.\n\n§YSparleto§! today, while not a modern city, is much better off than is was a few years ago. §YWingbardian§! investment has rejuvenated the city, and tourism brings in plenty of money. All around the city, a tourist can find beautiful examples of §Yclassical architecture§!, the most prominent example of which is the §YSparleto Academy§!, standing proudly above the city. The magnificent statues and paintings that adorn these structures have inspired a whole artistic movement, §YNeoclassicism§!, and many great archeological artifacts have been recovered from sites across §YArantiga§!. A tourist can find themselves wasting the day away in one of the fashionable coffee shops that dot §YSparleto§!, as long as one is careful enough to not bump into a military patrol by accident...\n\nHowever, all is not well in §YSparleto§!. §YArantigans§! are quickly becoming the §Rminority§! in their own city, owing to the large influx of §YWingbardian§! immigrants in recent years. The ancient §YSparlean§! language is rapidly dying out, and if drastic action is not taken, it, and thousands of years of §YArantigan traditions§!, could disappear forever..."

ARA_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ARA_napalm_desc:0 "In a war, there can be no half measures. Either we are the victors, or we suffer a most ignoble defeat. Thus, our bombers will begin carrying a more devastating weapon - napalm. After all, they can't keep the war up if all their factories are in flames."

#ARA_go_with_wingbardians_desc:0 "Our economy is already closely tied to Wingbardy. It only makes sense that we should therefore build up our ties and use them to our advantage. While this will, of course, make us dependent on Wingbardy, there are clear benefits to it as well."
#ARA_vinyards:0 "Expand Alubviran Vineyards"

#ARA_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
#ARA_tourism_desc:0 "Tourism is a wonderful thing. Ponies, griffons and even zebras come to visit and marvel at the wonders of our achievements. Encouraging them so that they come to spend their money in our country, therefore, is an excellent way to bring more money into our economy."

#ARA_cement_factories_desc:0 "Our nation, small as it is, is home to a wide variety of forests. From aging oaks to young maples, Arantiga has no lack of biodiversity. And yet we have scarcely utilised this natural resource. After deliberation with Wingbardian investors, we shall begin exploiting our forests, but for each tree felled, we shall plant two new ones. This prevents the erosion of the soil and preserves our natural beauty."
#ARA_industrial_assistance:0 "Request Industrial Assistance"

#ARA_cigars_desc:0 "Cigars are an excellent investment; not only are they used constantly, but they are easy to produce and will keep the citizenry placated. Rumours of life expectancy tanking as a result of overuse are just exaggerations."

ARA_new_age_new_army_desc:0 "We are entering a new era of warfare. Gone are the days of the spear and shield; now is the age of guns and tanks. In order to face the threats of the new millennium, both the civilian and the military sectors must be in perfect cooperation."
ARA_new_academy:0 "Meeting of the Generals"
ARA_new_academy_desc:0 "Once, we were the greatest nation on Griffonia, and we can do so again. The ancient military doctrines need to be adapted to modernity. It is time to develop new doctrines, and adapt to the ever-changing ways of war. Everybody has a different idea on how. The question is: which of our generals will we listen to?"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine:0 "From Zebrica with Speed"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Craterus has arrived from Zebrica, and brings with him the wonders of tanks, jeeps, and trucks. While the trenches of old stand tall and strong, these mechanical beasts lumber forth, destroying all who dare stand in our way. It is clear that adopting such a doctrine will only benefit us in the long run."
ARA_develop_doctrine:0 "Lead from the Front!"
ARA_develop_doctrine_desc:0 "It is said Arantigos liked to lead his army from the front. He did not fear danger and neither should our officers. If we are to adapt to risky manoeuvres, we need to show the troops that our officers are not afraid to lead them into battle!"
ARA_cult_of_speed:0 "A Cult of Speed"
ARA_cult_of_speed_desc:0 "Speed is the deciding factor in warfare. If you can decide where to fight and who you face when, you have already won half your battles. And if we can push forward faster than they can retreat, then our enemies have no chance against us."
ARA_actual_trucks:0 "Motorised Units"
ARA_actual_trucks_desc:0 "If one unit can act, both as a hammer, and as an anvil, exploiting gaps and keeping an enemy in place, then we should make haste to reform our army into a hundred of such units. By motorizing our units, we can not only move them faster, but also supply them better."
ARA_tanks_for_the_army:0 "Rolling Out"
ARA_tanks_for_the_army_desc:0 "Our armored behemoths are ready to go forth and destroy our enemies. The tank has become a great weapon of war, which can improve our fighting prowess tenfold, when used correctly. Our foes will always find our tanks one step ahead of them, waiting for the kill."
ARA_better_tanks:0 "Legions of Steel"
ARA_better_tanks_desc:0 "It is crucial to make sure our tanks do not become obsolete. Our enemies are numerous in number, and our industrial capacity is average is best. Thus it is imperative that our tanks are the best of the world, rather than relying on numbers."
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine:0 "Blow Them to Tartarus"
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Arantigos has always appreciated a weapon that can strike the enemy without fear of retaliation, and artillery does just that. It is as Nicator said, 'They cannot pose a threat if they are already dead.'"
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine:0 "Knights of the New Age"
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, knights have formed the backbone of Griffonian armies. While they have been largely supplanted by tanks, we have use for a hard-hitting force of armored knights, and we will incorporate them into our infantry doctrine."
ARA_mass_artillery:0 "Concentrated Fire"
ARA_mass_artillery_desc:0 "By concentrating all of our artillery fire on one location, we can not only wreak havoc on the enemy's defenses, but we can also break the enemy's will to fight. Our infantry should be able to mop them up easily, preserving our strength for when we need it."
ARA_better_artillery:0 "Modernise Our Artillery"
ARA_better_artillery_desc:0 "Catapults and ballistae have long since faded into legend, and the days of star forts and cannons have long passed. Technology marches forward relentlessly, and we must ensure that our howitzers and bunkers are a step above those of our enemies."
ARA_fancier_guns:0 "Equip the Vanguard"
ARA_fancier_guns_desc:0 "Having artillery is useless if we cannot defend them. Even with the advancements of a new age, the Arantigan soldier remains the mainstay of our army. By equiping them with our best equipment, we can prevent our artillery from being silenced by an enemy advance."
ARA_continous_planning:0 "Dedicated Officer Corps"
ARA_continous_planning_desc:0 "With our doctrine being centered around artillery, we must ensure that our commanders can put them to good use, while providing specialist training for dedicated artillery officers. This way, we can make the most out of our army."
ARA_new_school:0 "Revive the Sparleto Academy"
ARA_new_school_desc:0 "The Sparleto Military Academy in the heart of our capital has fallen into disrepair.

ARA_new_guns:0 "Equip the Army"
ARA_new_guns_desc:0 "Even with plenty of tanks and artillery, our infantry will form the backbone of our army. We need to ensure that they are fully armed and supplied with the latest weaponry and equipment, lest we suffer a humiliating defeat."
ARA_new_artillery:0 "Guns of the New Age"
ARA_new_artillery_desc:0 "No pillbox, no trench, no fortification will be able to stand up to our artillery salvos. We will force them to face us on even ground! After all, an Arantigan soldier is not worth the bones of a hundred enemy soldiers."
ARA_new_equipment:0 "Sturdy Shovels"
ARA_new_equipment_desc:0 "An infantryman cannot defend himself if he has no hole to hide in. Improving our support equipment should be a priority. An Arantigan infantryman should be able to march for days while fully packed. Surely they can carry an extra shovel or first aid kit."
ARA_spec_ops_program:0 "The Forze Speciali"
ARA_spec_ops_program_desc:0 "Unconventional warfare is the deadliest. Using new tactics, we can surprise our foes where they do not expect us. Cassander has already proved the worth of his ideas before, perhaps it is time to implement them into our doctrine."
ARA_nation_under_arms:0 "An Armed Society"
ARA_nation_under_arms_desc:0 "Tensions are rising rapidly all around us. It is clear that we cannot afford to stand back and watch the world burn. We must arm ourselves. Once, the entire nation was mobilised for conquest and if necessary, we can militarise again."
ARA_prepare_the_people:0 "Is a Polite Society"

ARA_the_cadets_desc:0 "The Cadetti are a branch of Arantigan military scientists, tasked with developing new weapons for the military. We should expand their ranks and make sure to also task them with civilian projects if necessary."
ARA_guerilla_warfare:0 "No Surrender"
ARA_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Surrender is the cowards’ path. We will fight to the death. Every last Arantigan will brave the perils of war, or die trying. The forests of Arantiga will be utilised for our partisan movement, with hidden equipment caches."
ARA_mandatory_training:0 "Mandatory Military Training"
ARA_mandatory_training_desc:0 "We cannot afford for everygriff to remain a civilian. Everyone must be ready to be conscripted if it is needed. Therefore, all griffons should be trained in the ways of war, so that new recruits can quickly be prepared for combat, should the need arise."
ARA_radio_stations:0 "Military Frequencies"
ARA_radio_stations_desc:0 "If you know what your enemy is up to, you have already won half of the battle. Although spies remain important, new technologies will allow us to see the world far more clearly. We should make use of this."
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws:0 "Expand Conscription"
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws_desc:0 "Our military is quite small, and as such, we need a greater proportion of bodies watching the borders. Updating our conscription laws should serve to fix this issue nicely."
ARA_military_railroads:0 "Is a Functioning Society"
ARA_military_railroads_desc:0 "A militarised society should use military precision and drill for every aspect of life. Much more can be pushed out of our infrastructure if we enforce exact timetables and sober use of seating on trains. This will effectively increase our infrastructure’s capacity."
ARA_builder_divisions:0 "Divisioni di Lavoro"
ARA_builder_divisions_desc:0 "The Divisions of Labour are a group of military engineers. These engineers specialise in constructing and maintaining the industry and infrastructure of our nation, military and civilian. It is time to give them the support they need to be more effective."
ARA_reservist_housing:0 "Reservist Housing"

ARA_fortified_nation:0 "Hunker Down"
ARA_fortified_nation_desc:0 "Compared to quite a few, our army is small, but elite. As such, we must secure every advantage we can that will inflict greater losses on the enemy for less of ours. It is time to dig in."
ARA_stocked_arsenals:0 "Stock the Arsenals"
ARA_stocked_arsenals_desc:0 "We cannot fight if we do not have guns. We need to make sure everygriff in our army is supplied and ready. The cost of preparation is invaluable, and the troops will appreciate our efforts."
#ARA_mobilized_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
#ARA_mobilized_economy_desc:0 "Our economy, while reasonable, is also mostly civilian. We must mobilise it and make it ready for war. A modern war is won on the homefront and if we are to win heroic victories, we should be supplied with legendary weaponry."

ARA_PR_victory:0 "A Victory For the Riformatore"
ARA_PR_victory_desc:0 "In a surprising sweep, the Riformatore have claimed victory in the elections. They are promising a harmonic state, similar to distant Equestria, but with our own unique characteristics. The griffons of Arantiga wish to shake off their militaristic mindset, to some extent."
ARA_welfare_state:0 "Benessere"
ARA_welfare_state_desc:0 "Arantigans are a proud people who never ask for much, but it is undeniable there is a section of society that subsists on far less than they should have.

ARA_educate_the_poor:0 "Educate the Impoverished"
ARA_educate_the_poor_desc:0 "Our education program is solid, but there are still some griffons who have never received proper schooling due to their destitute situation. An improvement to this situation is in order, and we aim to completely eliminate illiteracy in the next five years."
ARA_foreign_investors:0 "Foreign Investments"
ARA_foreign_investors_desc:0 "We have done much to improve our economy in the past year, but there is still much to do, and we cannot do it on our own. Tax breaks and subsidies should encourage wealthy foreigners to invest in Arantiga."
ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness:0 "Shake Claws With the Baroness"
ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness_desc:0 "The Baroness, while a noble, still ruled us well for many years. Cooperating with her would not only turn the conservatives to our side, but would increase our legitimacy as well."

ARA_SDL_victory:0 "The Sostenitori Win!"

ARA_industrial_development_PCNA:0 "National Industrialisation Effort"
ARA_industrial_development_PCNA_desc:0 "A strong state is an industrialised state. And more importantly, an industrialised state is an armed state. Our existing military factories must be expanded and improved, if we wish to preserve our new order."

#ARA_support_the_cult_of_megas_arantigos_desc:0 "Arantigos, the Griffon who lead our nation to rule over half of Griffonia. There is a widespread belief in Arantiga that Arantigos was the divine incarnation of Boreas, and his mission was to unite all Griffons. Ensuring these beliefs are no longer prosecuted will earn their gratitude and support for our own ends."

ARA_army_with_a_state_desc:0 "Every griffon a soldier! Under Dorotheos' rule Arantiga becomes increasingly militarised, more and more resources are directed to the army's needs. But if we truly want to rival the giants of Griffonia, we need to mobilise our entire society."

ARA_riches_of_griffonstone_desc:0 "The many mountains of Griffonstone are packed to the brim with valuable resources that we can use for our war effort.

ARA_hire_foreigners_desc:0 "We cannot rely just on our domestic scientists. There is simply too few of them, and it will take years, maybe even decades before we will able to become a truly modern nation. However, by using the most powerful thing in the world - money - we can 'convince' foreign scientists to come to Arantiga and help us develop our technologies - there is more than enough of those not caring who pays."
ARA_industrial_front:0 "The Year of National Effort"
ARA_industrial_front_desc:0 "Our enemies are numerous and powerful. There is no way we can reclaim what is rightfully ours without a sacrifice by every griffon in Arantiga.

ARA_work_camps_desc:0 "There are a large number of criminals, traitors, war captives and other enemies of the state that are just rotting in our prisons.

ARA_homefront_victory_desc:0 "By introducing new methods, rationalising processes of production and spreading worker-soldier ethos we have achieved an astounding success.

ARA_the_legacy:0 "Legacy of Arantigos"

ARA_the_emperor_desc:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Griffonian Empire has miraculously recovered. Now it is attempting to reconquer Griffonia. Opposing the northern juggernaut would surely be equal to suicide. King Nicator will offer to swear fealty to emperor Grover VI in hopes of keeping at least partial independence of Arantiga. Such is harsh reality..."
ARA_karthian_pact:0 "A Return to the Karthinian Pact"
ARA_karthian_pact_desc:0 "Wingbardy was perceived as the reason for our demise and Dorotheos made his opposition against it a key element of his politics.

ARA_die_is_cast_desc:0 "The Empire, Wingbardy, and Aquileia — three great powers of Griffonia who wrestle for control over the continent. Each of them is much more powerful than Arantiga and each of them has interest in claiming our lands. However, Arantigos the Great defeated armies many times the size of his own and so we will do. It will not be an easy task, but the stronger will be our foe, the greater will be our glory."
ARA_end_old_empire_desc:0 "For over two centuries Grovers ruled Griffonia. They crushed all resistance to their reign and surpassed even great Arantigos. Now however, their empire is in ruin, destroyed by Wingbardians and republicans. The child-emperor is no more than a puppet. We should end this farce before the Empire crumbles and something new emerges from its ruins."
ARA_fate_of_lord_protector_desc:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw was the leader of the military coup that led to the collapse of Griffonian Empire and to the end of Grovers. Even Arantigos must admit that he was a talented fellow. But the mighty griffon has fallen, now he rots in a miserable prison cell. And there is one last thing he can do for us..."
ARA_avenge_of_grover_desc:0 "Ferdinand did us a great favor by killing the child-emperor — we'd rather not get our claws dirty with poor chick's blood. Now when Arantigos proclaimed himself the savior of Griffenheim, Diamond Dogs consider him a hero. Although, we will probably never get their blind loyalty like Grovers did, the dogs will undoubtedly serve us well."
ARA_fate_of_child_emperor_desc:0 "Grover VI is just a powerless child. However, he is the last direct descendant of Grover I and an important symbol for those who hope to restore the former greatness of the Griffonian Empire. Executing a child — although being a great show of force — would surely strain our relations with Herzlanders and cause significant international reaction. We should get rid of him in a less direct manner."
ARA_force_dogs_to_dig_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs of Bronzehill are interesting creatures, they are fiercely loyal to the line of Grover. Due to malicious rumors about the true fate of Grover VI we cannot hope to ever gain their loyalty. Furthermore, they will surely try to undermine our support among other nations. So we will get rid of their leaders and relocate troublemakers to work camps, where they will do what dogs do best — dig."
ARA_triumph_in_griffenheim_desc:0 "Griffenheim — the seat of imperial power — is ours. Now no one can doubt Arantgos' right to rule all griffons. He will personally go to Griffenheim to celebrate his victory and make decisions on some matters crucial to governance of Herzland."
ARA_marriage_of_convience_desc:0 "Political marriages are as old as the nobility. Thanks to them many realms were united, many feuds ended, and many new ones started. After the death of king Moriset the Aquileian crown went to his daughter, Vivienne. Maybe, instead of fighting, Dorotheos should propose a marriage to the queen of Aquileia — and hopefully unite both realms."
ARA_royal_spouse_desc:0 "Queen Vivienne is quite an ambitious griffoness and unlike her father is actually a competent ruler. Although, allowing Aquileians to be fully independent would be foolish, surely we can reach some sort of agreement that will let us keep our western ally under control and sate Vivienne's ambitions. We are in no hurry because no matter what we do, in the future our lands will be united under one dynasty."
ARA_eastern_wind_desc:0 "Aquileian Army, although lacking in spirit, is an advanced and battle-hardened force. It would be beneficial to conduct joint military exercises to share our experience and knowledge. Some griffons in the Aquileian high command also suggested sending some of their officers to support the expansion of our armed forces — these griffons would be led by Gabriel Ostwind."
ARA_king_of_aquileia_desc:0 "There can be only one ruler of griffonkind — a Featherin — not a Discret. Although, currently Arantigos is only a king-consort of Aquileia, in time his real power will expand to that of a proper king. We will carefully gather support within the Aquileian goveernment until we will be able to strip Vivienne of her power and give control over Aquileia to Arantigos."
ARA_integrate_aquileian_army_desc:0 "With control over Aquileia we gain control over their armed forces. General staff of our armies will be merged, and, although Aquileians will keep some autonomy and will be still considered a separate formation, Arantigos will be new commander-in-chief of the Aquileian Army."
ARA_conteprise_desc:0 "With our relations with Aquileia properly established trade between our nations is flourishing. Several wealthy businessgriffs and ponies from Aquileia wish to expand their operations into Arantigan lands. Although, we have bad experiences with Wingbardians, we are now much stronger than years ago and can properly control these foreigners. So let us shake claws and make good business."
ARA_march_west_desc:0 "Aquileians are a bunch of buffoons that consider themselves more refined and cultured than the rest of griffonkind. Many despise them, but no one can conquer them. They are so powerful that even Arantigos the Great failed to do so — only Grovers succeded. We will follow in their footsteps and take Aquila into our claws."
ARA_secure_frontier_desc:0 "In the lands of Greifwald lie the largest oil fields of Griffonia. Developing this region allows us to both end our crippling lack of fuel and prepare for a future assault north due to its proximity to our border with Herzland."
ARA_oil_fields_of_adelart_desc:0 "Griffons love gold — black gold too. Newly acquired lands of Adelart allow us to easily tap into greifwaldian oil deposits."
ARA_secure_flank_desc:0 "The city-state of Flowena and the County of Pomovarra lie right next to our borders. Until now attacking them would be foolish, as it would surely cause an Aquileian invasion. However, now, when war is inevitable, we need to secure these lands."
ARA_flowenian_deal_desc:0 "Flowena is ours! Its bank vaults were sacked and our army paraded through its streets. Most citizens have already accepted their fate, they are unlikely to cause any large problems in the future. Curiously, some days ago we were approached by a former flowenan militia general with an interesting proposition..."
ARA_woe_to_the_vanquished_desc:0 "Although Aquileians fought hard, we have finally conquered Aquileia, crushing their dream of becoming the western hegemon. Now we need to deal with numerous revolutionaries that will try to undermine Arantiga as they did with Aquileia."
ARA_karthin_will_fall_desc:0 "Long ago lands of Wingbardy were a part of the empire of great Arantigos. It was embarrassing that for the last decades Arantiga was a half-puppet of its former subjects. It is revenge time now — we shall march on Karthin and depose these wannabe masters of the South."
ARA_francistrian_compatriots_desc:0 "Franmistria is the powderkeg of the South — Wingbardiands, Aquileians, and Arantigans under one government. With sudden rebirth of Arantiga Franmsitrian Arantigans decided to fight for our cause, we will supply them with weapons and trained officers to organise guerillas that will cause chaos in Fransmistria."
ARA_greater_arantiga_desc:0 "Our ancestral lands are reunited. Reintegration of these lands is proceeding swiftly — locals are more than eager to serve the cause of Arantigos. A large number of our new citizens and former guerilla fighters decided to enlist in our armed forces."
ARA_bitter_enemies_desc:0 "Falcor recently lost a war with Wingbardy, loosing its capital as a result. They have many reasons to hate their western neighbours besides that and their thirst for revenge is unsated. Maybe we should approach them and offer an alliance?"
ARA_reward_allies_desc:0 "Now, when Wingbardy has fallen, it is time to deal with Falcor. They fought alongside us... but do we really need them any longer? Their lands were a part of old arantigan realm too, and they would allow us to march further south..."

ARA_declare_arantigan_empire_desc:0 "With the greatest powers of Griffonia beaten, no one can challenge Arantigan dominance. Tens of millions of griffons bow to Arantigos. It is time to cement our claims and organise an imperial coronation ceremony in Griffenheim."

ARA_our_subjects:0 "Our Subjects"
ARA_our_subjects_desc:0 "We now rule millions of griffons of different religions, traditions, and languages. Arantigans are a minority in the new empire and maintaining our cultural hegemony is implausible in the long term. Although, we will never again abandon our ways, we should consider some concessions to new subjects of Arantigos to gain their trust."
ARA_expand_cult:0 "Expand the Cult of Second Arantigos"
ARA_expand_cult_desc:0 "Griffons of Arantiga are faithful believers of the newly reformed cult of Arantigos-Boreas that has already eclipsed other cults of the Trinity in our homeland. However, most of our new subjects still follow the Three Temples orthodoxy. While undermining cults of Arcturius and Eyr would be foolish and dangerous, we should expand the worship of Arantigos-Boreas to promote religious unity in our empire."
ARA_question_of_capital:0 "Question of Capital"
ARA_question_of_capital_desc:0 "While Sparleto has been a seat of Featherins for hundreds of years, it is a relatively small city, not worthy of the ruler of Griffonia due to its inability to house the constantly growing imperial bureaucracy. Therefore a question rises: to what city can we relocate our capital?"
ARA_establish_imperial_army:0 "Expand the Imperial Army"
ARA_establish_imperial_army_desc:0 "Until now our army was mostly composed of Arantigans and central griffonian auxiliaries. It was enough back then, but our unstoppable war machine is reaching the limit of its growth. We simply lack griffons to police our lands, forget about new conquests! If we wish to protect Arantiga, our armed forces need reorganisation and expansion."

ARA_reform_the_archonates_desc:0 "Archons have been leading numerous followers of the Three Temples for centuries. Holding large amounts of power, they form dangerous opposition to the Cult of Arantigos-Boreas. We need to reform the Archonates to better serve the Arantigan cause. Loyal prelate Heraclius was already appointed as the new archon of Arantigos-Boreas and will lead the reorganisation of the Three Temples."
ARA_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "Imperial Bureaucracy"
ARA_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "During our conquests, we governed new lands with the help of military governors and local collaborators. However, this was a temporary solution. In the long run this system is highly inefficient and is already causing us great trouble in the form of corruption and civil unrest. We need to create proper local administration, reform our central government, and establish a universal legal system."
ARA_establish_imperial_navy:0 "Establish the Imperial Navy"
ARA_establish_imperial_navy_desc:0 "For now our navy consisted of patrol boats on Lake Rumare. Our knowledge regarding creation of a proper oceanic fleet is lacking, besides we don't have experienced personnel. We couldn't capture any ships from our enemies because their crews either sunk them or sailed away on them to become pirates.

ARA_integrate_wingbardy:0 "Integrate Wingbardy"
ARA_integrate_wingbardy_desc:0 "Although Wingbardy was the main reason for the misery of our nation, Wingbardians themselves are very similar to Arantigans. Because of this, they quickly accepted our reign. Wingbardians view Arantigos as one of them, and we should make use of this sentiment."
ARA_integrate_aquileia:0 "Integrate Aquileia"
ARA_integrate_aquileia_desc:0 "Aquileia has always been a thorn in the side of the Empire — and Aquileians were a thorn inside of anyone who tried to rule them, even other Aquileians. But after getting swiftly defeated by us, they've had enough of revolting — at least for now."

ARA_just_good_business:0 "Just Good business"
ARA_just_good_business_desc:0 "Skyfall is the busiest port of Griffonia and its richest city. Having it in our possession, allows us to reap the benefits of griffonian trade.

arantiga.1.t:0 "The Issue of Arantigan Economic Dependence"
arantiga.1.d:0 "As a small nation in southern Griffonia, Arantiga has never had the best of economies. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed, and Arantiga truly became independent, the situation worsened.\n\nBut not all seemed lost. Arantiga united with the Wingbardians to our south, and joined the Karthinian Pact in hopes of defending against aggressors and rebuilding its economy.\n\nSadly, Wingbardy used their ever growing influence over us to profit from our weakened economy. This has become a massive issue in Arantigan politics, seeing as how Wingbardian entrepreneurs and companies seize a majority of the profits made.\n\nThe question has yet to answered. How will Arantiga continue on? Will we cut ties with the Wingbardians, and strive to become economically independent from them? Or will we try and simply lower their influence, in an attempt to minimise the cons and maximising the pros of their economic 'assistance'?"
arantiga.1.a:0 "Arantiga shall control its own destiny!"
arantiga.1.b:0 "Perhaps we could become equals instead?"

arantiga.2.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.2.d:0 "Today was the day Dorotheos had been waiting for.\n\nIt was just shortly after two in the afternoon, and it seemed as if half of Sparleto was up in arms. Together with his followers, Dorotheos plowed his way through the capital city, all the way to the government district. There, the first shots were exchanged between loyalist police forces and soldiers. As the battle in the streets began to flare up, Dorotheos and his personal guard managed to breach the defenses, and entered the House of Government.\n\nMargareth stood in front of the window in her office, observing the battle. She had already called for reinforcements when she heard the first reports of the possible coup, but for now, their defences would need to hold.\n\nSuddenly, the door to her office was busted open, and as Margareth turned around, she saw her own brother, revolver in his claw, approaching her. She walked backwards, hitting the window behind her. Dorotheos armed his revolver as Margareth closed her eyes, praying to the gods.\n\nJust as he is about to pull the trigger, voices sound from outside the office, getting closer and closer, to the point where they're just around the corner."

She held back the tears, at least for the moment, but she, and most likely everyone else in the courtroom knew that he was guilty, and that there was no hope in Boreas that he'd come out alive.\n\nThe trial itself did not take long. There were mountains of evidence, including witnesses, the many dead bodies in the streets of Sparleto and, last but not least, Margareth herself, whom he had tried to kill in person before her soldiers overwhelmed and arrested him.\n\nThe judge was cold, but only did his duty as he announced that Dorotheos was guilty as charged. Treason of the highest order. The punishment was none other than death.\n\nAs the guards dragged a grim-looking Dorotheos out of the courtroom, and past Margareth, she couldn't help but finally break out into tears."

Criticizing the government and the Baroness' rule was no longer punishable, and any restrictions on forming political organisations were removed as well. Soon enough democrats and national communists were spreading word of their ideologies and finding more support among the dissatisfied populace.

To the relief of most griffons, the talks have been a success, and the old nobility shall support the democratically chosen government of Arantiga.

One of his first decisions was leaving our formal alliance pact.\n\nAlthough Arantigan history is certainly impressive, yet filled with bloodshed, the joint military staffs of the Pact believe there is no real threat coming from such a minor nation.

arantiga.001.d:0 "A cafe situated in the capital of Arantiga was filled with off-duty soldiers, among them lieutenants, generals, and even the marshal. Dorotheos  Featherin sat exclusively with his closest generals, discussing a plan of great importance. Dorotheos had great ambitions, ambitions of restoring Arantiga, and today was the day he'd set his plan in motion.\n"So, colleagues, are we in agreement?" The generals looked at each other, some unsure, some appalled. "A coup, sir? Are you sure?" asked one, putting down his cup of coffee. "Of course, dear Soter. We have the support of the army, who would oppose us? Her guard? Opposing the military would be suicidal. Cassander?" He nodded, speaking in agreement, "Absolutely suicidal! All significant griffs support us."\nDorotheos  continued, looking at his third general, "Lysimachus, any objections?" He shrugged, saying, "What about those, who don't? Nicator isn't on board, and many love the Baroness..." Dorotheos chuckled, grinning warmly. "Oh, Lysimachus, trust me, trust your marshal!""

arantiga.002.t:0 "The Planning"
arantiga.002.d:0 "Deep within the Arantigan countryside sat a simple homestead, only connected to the closest population center by a small dirt path. Around it, soldiers stood guard waiting for the last general to arrive. Finally, Lysimachus approached via flight, landed, and rushed in, slamming the door shut.\nLysimachus sat down with the other Generals, who all turned to him, "Excuse me, I'm late". Dorotheos looked up from the map, his annoyance masked by seriousness. "Well, Lysimachus, let me get you up to speed..." In the middle of the table laid a map, containing the latest drawing of Sparleto, the arantigan capital.\n"The plan is simple. By my order Nicator will be stationed at the border, under the false pretense that foreign revolutionaries are trying to pass it". Next spoke Soter, "I plan to keep my troops out of sight, if all goes south we'll call for backup". Dorotheos looked at Cassander, who responed, pointing at key locations on the map, "I will relieve the police chief of his burden and supplant the police force with my troops, if all goes well, the city should be under our control. Lysimachus?"\nThe next griffon cleared his throat, "Indeed, I'll have my troops stationed at all checkpoints around the city, no griffon goes in or out until Dorotheos is in charge" Dorotheos nodded, "Any objections?" The generals sat silently, the meeting was concluded."
arantiga.002.a:0 ""Then we are set.""
arantiga.003.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.003.d:0 "Marshal Dorotheos Featherin was nervous, months fo planning led to what was about to happen today. He was ready, but his chest felt heavy, filled with anxiety. This was the first time he'd lead forces, he has never fought in a formal war, nor lead a coup, his military background was comprised of drills and skirmishes with banditry, this would be the first time...\nBut, despite his lack of experience, he would handle this with tact. He would not spill a drop of blood. He needed to prevent all thoughts of a counter-coup. His clean takeover would show who Dorotheos is, and how much his people mean to him.\nHe was escorted to the palace, coming face to face with the palace's guard and his sister, Margareth Featherin, the baroness. He needed to handle this properly. He and his griffons made their way as close as they could before the palace guards demanded they halt.\nDorotheos knew what he had to do. His guards parted and he came out, megaphone in claw, unarmed (covertly he always kept a revolver as all generals do). He looked at the guards, and pleaded his case.\n"Look..." He began, the megaphone barely up to his beak, he was very well within shooting distance of the Guards. "I don't mean to spill arantigan blood, I want arantiga to prosper..." He looked up at the armed guards, "Isn't that what you fight for? Or do you fight for her? The Baroness?" He rolled his eyes.\n"My dear sister, clawless, bent her knee to Wingbardy, what kind of fight is that? Is it even a fight? Is this what you're going to die for? What's the point of her reign? I am offering you the chance to lay down your arms, and simply... Go home. Go home to your families, be it your mothers and fathers..." He lowers his voice, "...or your sons and daughters. Go home and the next time you come here, you won't be taking up arms for Wingbardy or this excuse for a Baroness!"\nDorotheos took to the sky, clenching his claw, "You will take them up for yourselves, for your families... FOR ARANTIGA!""
arantiga.003.a:0 ""Speak softly, and carry a big megaphone.""
arantiga.004.t:0 "Finality"
arantiga.004.d:0 "Dorotheos stood before his sister's chambers, having stared at the door for what seemed like hours, wondering what would happen, what he would do, how he would do it, and how she’d respond. Would she fight? Was it so silent because she had taken her life already? Dorotheos reached for the revolver on hip, turned the doorknob.\nNothing. He entered and closed the door behind him. As if this was any old visit, raising his eyes to his ‘dear sister’. A quill in claw, she was writing on a piece of parchment. She paused for a moment before continuing.\n"Sister..." Dorotheos began, before she interjected, a shaky sound to her voice, she was on the brink of crying, "At least let me finish, this will be my last will and my testament..." Dorotheos nodded, thinking to himself, how unpleasant this must be. Soon she finished, stood up, simply stating, "Get it done."\nDorotheos looked at his revolver, loaded one round, he thought how symbolic it would be — this coup had one singular shot fired, with one singular casualty.

arantiga.005.d:0 "Arantiga is famous for its martial traditions - even after the Kingdom of Sparleos collapsed due to infighting between generals and heirs of Arantigos the Great, arantigan military training remained excellent. In fact, when Grover I conquered Griffonia, he used arantigan legions as a base for his new imperial army. Even now, there is a number of arantigan mercenary groups, renowned for their expert training, roaming the griffonian continent and other parts of the world — many of them, despite never seeing their homeland are still keeping those old military traditions alive. Now, when Dorotheos is in charge, one of these groups, Sons of Arantigos, which gained fame in Zebrica, where they fought against the Storm King's army, returned to our nation and pledged fealty to the new baron. Its captain, Craterus, suggested that he could contact other groups to try and convince them to join Dorotheos’ cause."

He was trying to focus on the map of the border between Arantiga and the Griffonian Empire, when he suddenly felt dizzy. Moments later everything went black and Dorotheos fell from his chair.\n...beautiful. He could not find a better word. Nothing in the world of mortals could be compared to the heavenly mountains that stood in front of him. So... Is this the end? He walked forward, until he reached a garden, in the middle of which stood a gorgeous golden fountain... Everything looked exactly as the priests had told – however there were no gods and for sure, none of his ancestors... Dorotheos frowned when he realised, that in afterlife he might actually meet his sister... That wouldn't be a pleasant meeting. What if he was in hell? He had once heard a half-mad priest saying that hell is not a realm of tortures, but simply eternal solitude – worst punishment that gods could create. Dorotheos sat on one of the benches and hid his face in his claws... When he had moved them away, he was not alone anymore...\nA young white-feathered griffon was admiring one of the flowers. When he turned around, Dorotheos saw a mysterious light shining within his eyes. Somehow, Dorotheos felt like he had already met this griffon before... "Welcome, I have been expecting you for some time". Said the stranger. "Expecting me? Why?" asked Dorotheos. "Well, I have been watching you for some time and I am very impressed. You met my expectations, but I would be rather surprised if you didn't. We are in a certain way one, you and me...""

Gone were the days, when he seemed perpetually distracted, but suddenly could start screaming at servants for no reason. Most of his subordinates were relieved — the cunning general, conqueror of Central Griffonia, they followed, was back. Although doctors suggested he rest, Dorotheos decided not to delay his planned coronation – to cement his recent conquests Arantiga would be elevated to the status of kingdom!\nThe ceremony took place in recently rebuild Griffinstone – however all traces of the former Guto dynasty were removed from the palace and replaced with symbols of the house of Featherin. Crowds of arantigan soldiers and citizens gathered to participate in the ceremony that meant the return of old glory. When Dorotheos was crowned by prelate Heraclius, he decided to deliver a speech to gathered griffons.\n"Brave soldiers of Arantiga and hard-working citizens, it was a long road, but here we are... The name of Arantiga echoes through Griffonia and other nations fear and respect us. No longer when griffons hear about Arantiga they look at each other with confusion. We will restore the glory of the great Arantigan Empire... We, Arantigos, are back, and we will once again lead Arantiga into the future! Glory to Arantiga!"\n"GLORY TO ARANTIGA!" started chanting those, who already knew what their baron was planning.

A few relics of the past, which had survived the recent refurnishment of the palace, ordered by Arantigos, laid around the room waiting to be given the attention they deserved. Much like the depraved city itself until Arantigos finally stepped in. He turned to a mosaic that depicted Grover receiving a blessing from Boreas himself. It lacked more than a few stones but still looked magnificent.\nFor a brief moment Arantigos wondered about Grover's thoughts, when he had been sitting here in this palace, planning his seemingly impossible conquests all those years ago. Could he conquer Griffonia, had he not possessed the Idol? Cracking sounds of an opening door returned him to reality. A group of his soldiers dragged in a brown-white, very loudly cursing griffoness. When they came closer, she was tossed before the throne.\n\n"We told you to do this in a civilised manner". Arantigos told the commander of the soldiers. \n\n"Lord Arantigos, she told us she had more important business than answering your questions. She called you a ‘warlord with an ego the size of the Griffinstone Tree’, and resisted arrest."\n"I was wrong. His ego is the size of the goddamned Lake Rumare!" the griffoness recoiled, looking at a rather kitschy painting depicting Arantigos the Great handing down a sword to Dorotheos. "This place was trashy before, but now it looks like an Aquileian circus!" \n"We must admit, she has guts..." said Arantigos, "...But you are not here to give me advice on decor. The Idol of Boreas. We were told, that you and some equestrian ponies were the last ones to try and reclaim it. Where is it?"\n"The Idol? It fell deeper into the Abysmal Abyss which happens to be a death trap, in case you forgot. Besides, it's just a useless piece of gold... at least so I heard. Going down there is suicide, and the idol is completely lost. No one can get down there safely because of the wind, flowing at the speed of a train. We were lucky to make it out of there at all."\n"You will show us that place..." Arantigos smiled faintly, "...and then we will see if it really is ‘completely lost’ as you said."\n"Only a madgriff would try to go down there! You're not THIS crazy, are you?!"\n"They asked us the same question when we marched on Griffinstone..."

Every morning in his lavishly decorated palace he wakes up from the same nightmare: he's staring into her eyes, as cities fall and griffons bow before him, all he hears is her question — "Brother, do you still think it was worth it?""

Why am I listening to this? Does he really think I have nothing better to do? However the pony was not the biggest problem. The throne, Dorotheos was sitting on, always very comfortable, now seemed like torture device — Dorotheos simply could not find a position in which he would not feel pain. "Enough! Get away or I will order you executed!" He suddenly screamed. The pony froze, mumbled something apologetically, and galloped out of the room. Dorotheos rose from his throne. "Replace this goddamn chair!" he ordered his secretary. The old griffon nodded, saying, "Yes my baron, it shall be done". Over the years the secretary learned not to argue with Dorotheos, when he is in a bad mood. In the last few weeks most of the furniture got replaced, because Dorotheos ordered to remove all items that reminded him of his dead sister... "

It wasn't strange for a feather to appear here, griffons lose some of them from time to time, however this was not an ordinary feather... Dorotheos looked closer, then he felt like his heart had stopped for a second, and then he started screaming, "GUARDS! GUARDS!" Two soldiers guarding the doors to his office rushed inside with guns in their claws, ready to defend their baron from an intruder. Except, there was no intruder to be found, instead, they saw Dorotheos shaking in his chair, pointing at a violet feather. "WHAT IS THAT?! WHERE IS SHE?!" He screamed. Guards looked confused. One of them slowly approached the offensive item and gave it a closer look. "I think, your majesty, one of the new maids dropped it. Clumsy bird, next time she will leave feathers in tea..." Dorotheos blinked at in confusion. "A maid?" He asked. "Yes, sir, her coat has exactly this colour". The baron's fist violently hit his table, "I order her fired! She has to leave this residence now! NOW!" Guards quickly left the room, afraid of becoming the next target of their baron's fury. Dorotheos started mumbling to himself, "Yes, it was just a maid. I killed her, right? She's dead!""

Until this moment all attempts to retrieve the artifact failed, and many returned from the rift with nothing – many more perished in the process. Dorotheos, however, is not an ordinary adventurer - he is blessed by Boreas himself, in a way he and Boreas are one and the same – no matter what darkness he will meet, he shall prevail."

He initially does not react to the intruder, who slowly approaches him holding the handle of the revolver on his side. However, when Dorotheos shortens the distance between them to just a couple steps, he starts speaking.\n"You are a fool to come here, young conqueror. You wish to reclaim what was long lost... In a way it was lost even before it ended up here. It is a useless item, a relic of a god that no longer cares for his creations... You think, you will be blessed with its power. So foolish.

He wandered the maze for countless hours, but the Idol was nowhere to be found. Dorotheos panics and tries to fly up to escape the rift, the wind returns and forces him to land. After several attempts he gives up and just sits down, gazing into the slowly weakening magic spark of his lamp.\nIt is there... waiting. He needs to be patient — light keeps it away, but soon, the light will fade. The lamp eventually fails, Dorotheos smiles to himself and closes his eyes.\nHe only hopes that the gods will be merciful... That is, if he will ever get out of this cursed oblivion."

Somehow, he knows, that he would not want to see what may be behind him. After several minutes of walking, he approaches something that seems to be a palace hall, carved in stone. What a bizzare place for such construction. Who is this made for? He passes numerous columns, their top parts fading in the darkness above, he spends some time looking at statues depicting numerous griffons — all of them wearing crowns, diadems and other symbols of royal power. He recognises some of them – king Guto VI, Kihai de Kissau, Gerad Discret... Finally he approaches the end of the hall.\nAt the end stands an empty throne, words, carved in its foundation, spell, "Grover of Griffinstone". Next to it lies an old sword covered in rust...

He did not stay in Griffinstone — he moved forward and conquered countless nations. He must do the same — it is his destiny. Perhaps we will never find peace... But he is not looking for peace, he craves war and glory. When he rises up, he sees a passage he failed to notice before.\n The road is getting more and more narrow as Dorotheos moves through it – in the end he has to squeeze himself through a gap between two rocks. At last he enters another chamber. He is certainly not alone, he feels it. He clenches his claw on the ancient sword...\n"Brother... you have finally come". Dorotheos knows this voice, and he knows that its owner can't say these words. From the darkness emerges his long dead sister, Margareth. She seems sad... "It has been a while, hasn’t it?" she asks. "You are just a ghost of this cursed place. You are not real". Replies Dorotheos. "Am I? What if you are dead just like me? You died in this endless void and now wander here, alone, haunted by your doubts and past sins... You can't go to Heaven. This is the right place for you". Dorotheos frowns hearing these words. "What do you want?" Margareth smiles warmly, "I came here to help you. You need a guide, someone to show you the way". "And why would I trust you?" suspisiously asks Dorotheos. "I am your sister. I still love you, even after what you've done, Dorotheos".\n\nThe king slowly approaches the ghost of his sister..."

He wondered if it would stay like that.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, when the light of his lamp faded almost completely, he saw a small reflex of light shining from under a small pile of rocks. As he approached his reward revealed itself — the Idol of Boreas. Picking it up, Dorotheos felt nothing special... It was a bit warm but showed no signs of supernatural powers, the voice of Boreas did not speak to Dorotheos. But without any doubt he was holding the Idol. He chuckled quietly. So was it all for nothing? Well, perhaps it would not make him an undefeatable warrior like Grover, but griffons would definitely believe that he is the chosen one. Is this a good enough reward?\nWhen Dorotheos started climbing, winds seemed weaker than before, as if something shielded the king from them. He was climbing for hours, but finally he reached the top of the rift. His guads were relieved to see their ruler alive and well. And when he took out the Idol from his bag, they were mesmerised. Some of them knelt and started praying to Boreas. Dorotheos put the ancient artifact back into the bag and sat on the ground, catching his breath... He then looked back into the pit and gave an order. "Destroy it. No matter how many explosives it takes I want it to disappear"."

However the plan crumbled, when rebels failed to break through the palace guard, which unlike during the Ides of March coup, fought 'till the last griffon, buying enough time for loyalist forces to counter-attack and push back the rebels. Skirmishes were happening throughout the day, until last pockets of rebels surrendered. Nicator was captured and brought before the king...\n...for a long moment he stood in silence. Dorotheos saw no fear in Nicator’s eyes — only contempt. "Why did you betray us? You were a part of our staff, you fought with us. When the final victory would be ours, your reward would be immense. And yet you turned against us, Arantigos..."\nNicator spat on the floor, "This is exactly why I turned against you, Arantigos. We?

Many of them were sold - Arantiga was in desperate need of money to fuel its constantly expanding war machine, but some of those were given to chosen associates of the king. When traversing the vast garden of the residence, Soter noticed a lack of servants — only a few soldiers from Nicator's personal division were standing guard here. The whole place seemed like a military HQ. His host welcomed him on the porch and, after shaking claws, they sat down in comfy chairs. A young griffon in a corporal's uniform brought a bottle of local wine and, saluting th generals, quickly disappeared.\n"So, my friend, I must say you obtained a jewel of Rumare, but, I guess, showing it to me was not the reason I was invited here, was it? All these soldiers, loyal only to you... You clearly want our conversation to remain between us".\nNicator smiled faintly and took a small sip of wine. "Indeed Soter, indeed... You are one of the few griffons of authority I can trust. Lysimachus is a mindless fanatic, and Craterus has only recently joined our ranks. These are dire times, when trusted friends are few and hard to come by. I believe the time to act has come, soon we will be dragged into a war, we cannot win. Dorotheos... He is mad. You heard his speech during the coronation... he thinks he's Arantigos! This is madness, he wants to wage war against the entire world! He will lead us to certain death!"\n"Well, it had seemed we could not win against Griffonstonians, but here we are..." Soter chuckled, "Here we are, enjoying the boons of an improbable victory. But I must agree with you, this has come too far. The captain of the royal guard is a good friend of mine, he was telling me some disturbing stories lately. I think Dorotheos is slowly losing his mind. But he hasn't failed us so far. And the soldiers love him, they will follow him to the end, be it bitter or sweet. In the face of certain defeat, Lysimachus will rather die than betray him. Cassander, I guess, will follow him too."\n"What about you?" asked Nicator.\n"Me?" Soter stayed silent for a while, "We are surrounded by enemies — Aquileia, the Empire, Wingbardy — They will come for us at some point. We need Dorotheos to win. Even if he is a madgriff, he is still a brilliant commander". Soter finished his glass of wine and concluded the exchange, "I will pretend we've never had this conversation".\nA few hours later when Soter had left residence, he knew it was time to start acting.

He ordered to fortify the city and mobilised all loyal griffons he could — those who didn't receive a gun were ordered to dig trenches and build barricades. When Lysimachus' forces arrived, they directly attacked the city, hoping that one decisive push would make the regent's forces to lose faith in victory and abandon their leader. However after the initial push, the army of Lysimachus was trapped in bloody urban combat on the narrow streets of Sparleto. After two days of fighting the frontline started stabilising... Until due to blind luck, an artillery shell directly hit the field HQ, which Lysimachus was visiting to personally inspect his troops...\nWith the death of their commander, Lysimachus' forces surrendered. Nicator had beaten the largest clique of the rebellious armies and in the following days many officers proclaimed loyalty to the new regent."

arantiga_chaos.003.d:0 "Today in Sparleto Nicator Whitebeak was crowned the new king of Arantiga. His recent victories over warlords, who tried to plunge the country into chaos, and quick restoration of order made him a popular figure among the citizens, so there was little resistance to his coronation. After the ceremony, when Nicator left the temple of Boreas to deliver a speech to the crowds of citizens, he proclaimed that peace and prosperity would return to Arantiga and its citizens would no longer die for ambition of madgriffs. Arantiga wouldn't forget about her past but would also move towards a better future — not one of war and bloodshed."
arantiga_chaos.003.a:0 "Long live the king!"
arantiga_chaos.004.t:0 "Elections"
arantiga_chaos.004.d:0 "In a rather unexpected move, regent Nicator announced that arantigan monarchy would be abolished and instead democratic elections would be organised. He declared that monarchy has clearly failed both in Arantiga and in other countries of Griffonia, ruled by tyrannical kings and emperors, it was the commongriffs who would lead the nation into the future. Not long after that, elections took place and the vote was mainly divided between two of the candidates:\n\n Antioco Moro, who has recently returned to the country after being forced to leave when Dorotheos Featherin nationalised Wingbardian industry. And, to many griffons' surprise, general Soter, who gathered support of left-leaning parties creating the centre-left coalition.\n\n The votes have been counted and the public wishes to know: who won the elections?"
arantiga_chaos.004.a:0 "Congratulations to Antioco Moro and his Partito Riformatore!"

##### GOVERNING EMPIRE EVENTS####
arantiga.050.t:0 "Nations of the Empire"
arantiga.050.d:0 "With recent victories we gained control over a large part of Griffonia. Back when Dorotheos was getting crowned as king arantigans were a minority in our country - and now we are outnumbered many times by people of nations we have conquered. We can't control all those griffons using only our loyal arantigan citizens, if we want our regime to survive, we will need to delegate power to locals.\n Probably the safest choice would be relying on Wingbardians and other southerners as the new dominant group of the Arantigan Empire — most of them support their new ruler — Arantigos. In fact, despite our attempts to restore the old sparlean culture, arantigans remained very similar to Wingbardians. Another option would be to support the largest ethnic groups — Aquileians, Herzlanders and Wingbardians, letting them assimilate minorities. Conversely we can establish laws protecting freedom of all nationalities within our Empire, hopefully gaining their sympathy for our cause at the expense of our centralisation and government integrity."
arantiga.050.a:0 "Only southerners can be trusted."
arantiga.050.b:0 "Support three major groups."
arantiga.050.c:0 "Equality under the Emperor."
arantiga.051.t:0 "Choosing our Capital"
arantiga.051.d:0 "For centuries Sparleto was the seat of the Featherin dynasty. The ancient city has a long and proud history. However, as our empire grows, so do the needs of its government. Sparleto is simply too small — it can’t hold all the necessary institutions and offices. Besides, its rather provincial character obviously does not suit its new status of the imperial capital. To better govern our empire, it would be reasonable to choose a bigger, better strategically located city as our capital. The best candidate is Karthin — the former Wingbardian capital, it would be easy to govern, as its population is not hostile to us. Some however suggest that Griffenheim, the seat of Grovers would best fit the splendeur of Featherins and, thanks to its location in the center of Griffonia, would make governing our empire easier. But there's also the third option: instead of moving, we could make Sparleto worthy of our emperor by starting an ambitious program that would expand the city into a proper metropolis. The cost of such undertaking would be quite substantial and we would have to demolish and rebuild many historical districts. This, however, might be the best option, as Sparleto's location makes it unreachable for enemies and allows for easy governance of our lands."
arantiga.051.a:0 "Let us move south, to Karthin."
arantiga.051.b:0 "Griffinheim would be best"
arantiga.051.c:0 "We shall stay in Sparleto!"
arantiga.052.t:0 "Sparleto is now a great city"
arantiga.052.d:0 ""You can feel it in the air, the very breeze that blows between the new marble buildings of Sparleto carries with it the glory of our empire. There is no doubt about it, citizens of this great city, the second age of arantigan glory has come, and with it came new opportunities for all of our subjects. A dozen years ago travel from Ponteles to where i'm standing took 3 times longer than it does now..."\n\n\n\n                                Extract from a speech given by His Imperial Majesty Arantigos II in Sparleto,[GetDateText]."

arantiga.067.a:0 "An unexpected response"
arantiga.068.t:0 "Fezeran response"
arantiga.068.d:0 "Today we received a letter from the fezaran government. In a rather lengthy way it described how and where the Emperor can screw himself. The courier has already been executed."
arantiga.068.a:0 "Insulent bastards!"
arantiga.056.t:0 "Northern Tribes"
arantiga.056.d:0 "In frozen northern tundra, since times immemorial, live tribes of ponies. For centuries they paid little interest to matters of the civilised world, and not even Grovers cared enough for these desolate lands to conquer them. Now however, ponies found themselves in a conflict with skynavian communists, who invaded their homeland. When arantigan legions marched north, we conquered Skynavia and the northern ponies. Now it is time to deal with them — as their lands are sparsely populated we can simply integrate them into our empire. However, currently we can gain little profit from them, and making them usable will strain our economy and cause dissent among the locals. Perhaps, it would be easier to create an autonomous region for them..."
arantiga.056.a:0 "We do not need them."
arantiga.056.b:0 "Integrate them."
arantiga.057.t:0 "Riches of Skyfall"
arantiga.057.d:0 "After their defeat at the claws of the great armies of Arantigos, Skyfall now stands under our control. Keeping the current ruling oligarchs in charge of city for now will provide a better image of our occupation forces within the minds of the populus, therefore keeping them peaceful, as well as ensuring the loyalty of the ruling class. On the other hand we could strip these facetious oligarchs of their possessions and establish full control over their former property and the city. This will undoubtedly anger Skyfall's oligarchy, but they aren't in any position to resist the decisions we make. Because if they try, they will face the wrath of the great emperor of Arantiga and the imperial military."
arantiga.057.a:0 "Let the oligarchs be, they are best suited for the task."
arantiga.057.b:0 "No, Skyfall is ours to do as we please, the oligarchs shall have none of it."
arantiga.058.t:0 "Arantigan Invasion"
arantiga.058.d:0 "Came news of great urgency — apparently some wanna-be god-emperor from the continent, Dorotheos Featherin, after somehow beating Aquileia, the Empire, and Wingbardy has decided to finish what he started — and now the arantigan fleet is headed towards Haukland. Right now is our last chance to pack up all the loot we have gathered and move to some nice, warm place... Macawia perhaps?"
arantiga.058.a:0 "Maybe it's time for retirement..."
arantiga.058.b:0 "NO!"
arantiga.059.t:0 "Abandoned Haukland"
arantiga.059.d:0 "As our forces were approaching Haukland, they were getting suspicious — not a single attack got carried out by local pirates. When the first batch of troops landed, they expected an ambush. However the islands were deserted — apparently most of the pirates either left the place or were hiding from us. When the locals got questioned, the truth was revealed — apparently the mad graff and his most loyal supporters packed up all the treasures they could and set sail to one of pirate safe havens. The remnants of his ragtag "army" ran away on their own. They are not our problem anymore."
arantiga.059.a:0 "That was unexpected!"
arantiga.060.t:0 "Haukland will fight!"
arantiga.060.d:0 "Haukland decided to refuse our proposition and go down fighting rather than to simply let us have their land. What brutes!"
arantiga.060.a:0 "War it is then."
arantiga.061.t:0 "Knights of the East"
arantiga.061.d:0 "When Grover II started his doomed to fail crusade against the eastern ponies, he founded several knightly orders. After his death, those knights established themselves as defenders of the East and in some cases even created their own states like Hellquil and Longsword. While in western Griffonia the age of chivalry ended long ago with the beginning of the industrial era, in less developed lands of the East these traditions remained alive and in some cases got twisted beyond imagination. Now Hellsword and the Evi Valley are parts of our Empire and the future of knightly orders is uncertain. There are two options for them: either we allow them to exist under our guidance, joining them together with our own knights, such as the Sons of Arantigos, or the orders get disbanded and their soldiers get drafted to serve in our regular army as officers."
arantiga.061.a:0 "Our knights will fight together!"
arantiga.061.b:0 "Their time has come to an end."
arantiga.062.t:0 "The Trade Company"
arantiga.062.d:0 "Gryphus Southern Continent Company was institutionalised under an imperial charter granted by Grover III, which gave them rights to trade in the Gryphus Sea. Although with the collapse of the Griffonian Empire that charter became no more than a regular piece of paper, thanks to substantial influence the company held, they maintaned a strong position in the southern seas. It being not as influential as the bank of Flowena or oligarchs of Skyfall, Arantiga paid little interest to the Trade Company. Now however, when we are in control of Gryphus, the time to tie up this loose end has come. The Company is still successfully operating, and we could let them be, as long as they pay their taxes, bringing large sums of money into our budget. The new competitive environment won't allow them to hold a monopoly over the eastern trade, but in this case, they will stay as the dominant player in the region, slowing down growth of the local economy, therefore, another good option would be to nationalise their assets."
arantiga.062.a:0 "Let them operate."
arantiga.062.b:0 "Nationalise them."
arantiga.063.t:0 "Fate of Asterion"
arantiga.063.d:0 "We are now in control of The Asterion Archipelago — the home of minotaurs. For centuries minotaurs have been resisting the imperial rule and finally won their freedom in the Restoration War of 979. Bulls are known for their stubbornness — even now their guerillas fight our Asterion occupation forces. Controlling their islands will be a nightmare. It may take many years before we will be able to establish stable rule. Perhaps it would be better to grant minotaurs self-governance, by making them an autonomous region of the Arantigan Empire, and make sure that rights of bulls on the continent will be respected?"
arantiga.063.a:0 "No deals with minotaurs!"
arantiga.063.b:0 "Leave them on their islands."
arantiga.064.t:0 "Imperial Nightmare"
arantiga.064.d:0 "After the fall of Cloudbury, many republicans tried to escape or retreated into mountains to continue the fight from there. Arantigan intelligence cooperated with the military, conducting raids on mountain holdouts to finally eradicate the republican threat. However, killing the rebels was not the true goal of the operation — the main objective was to capture as many prominent republican leaders as possible, especially Kemerskai himself. After a month of clever sabotage by the intelligence and unrelenting assaults by the army, the operation was successfully concluded. President-Marshal was publicly executed a day after his capture on the main square of Cloudbury. Many of his subordinates were not as lucky — they died during or after lengthy interrogations, often with use of tortures, in which information about republican cells wes being gathered gathered. In following months after the operation executioners across the Arantigan empire worked relentlessly, while work camps once again got filled up with new batches of prisoners arriving daily."

arantiga_govern.012.t:0 "The Imperial Parliament"
arantiga_govern.012.d:0 "Republicanism was crushed — the so-called President-Marshal is dead and so are his cronies. Most of those who are still alive either fled the nation or hid, leaving their ambitions behind. But even after we proved the "Republican Dream" to be just a chickish fantasy, many influential pro-republican groups remain in our empire, spreading propaganda among the locals, who criticise actions of the central government alarmingly often now. Ruling with an iron claw won't be hard for a while, but as memories of victories fade, dissent will rise once again, ultimately leading to a revolution. We can crush every sign of resistance and keep the absolute power of our divine emperor — but will this be a time-proof decision? Some businessgriffs and nobles propose a form of political representation for various social classes — The Imperial Parliament. We will build a magnificent edifice for representatives to argue about meaningless problems... The people will be too busy observing them arguing to turn against the government. We could also use these representatives as counterweights to local officials, making the Emperor look like a ruler, deeply concerned about well-being of his subjects, a ruler, who listens to pleas of common griffons oppressed by local governors..."

arantiga_govern.013.t:0 "Faith and the Throne"
arantiga_govern.013.d:0 "Griffonia is home to many griffon nations, who worship different gods. Of course The Trinity is the dominant faith and most griffons in one way or another worship it. However, even within The Three Temples ceremonies vary wildly between regions. Because of this, keeping orthodoxy intact was a hard challenge for generations of archons. But there are also worshippers of minor deities like Eviliana or The Wise Lady, strange cults like The Old Believers, the druidic pantheon of the eastern ponies, who worship their own gods and spirits, and many more quasi-religions, making religious regulation on the continent a total mess. When The Arantigan Empire was established, alongside it spread the cult of Arantigos-Boreas and the cult of Second Arantigos. As we took control over the archonates of The Three Temples we reformed them to follow our new version of the faith in The Trinity, This, of course, created a substantial resistance among traditionalists and led to several schisms. Fortunately, it seems, most griffons managed to adjust to the changes and, hopefully, The Imperial Cult will sometime become a pillar of The Empire’s stability. Zealots suggest we should further spread The Cult of Arantigos and issue the Edict of The Imperial Cult, making it not only the official religion, but the only allowed religion inside The Empire. This would be a borderline insane decision, millions of griffons would resist it, unwilling to abandon their gods, it would send the country into a period of strife, critically undermining stability of Dorotheos' reign short-term, but ultimately creating a more homogeneous religious environment, allowing for better control and stability in the future. In contrast to that, issuing the Edict of Tolerance, that would let followers of religions non-hostile towards our regime (Excluding mad murderers, such as Maarites!) praise their gods freely, would be a much safer option for now."

arantiga_govern.014.t:0 "Nobles of the Empire"
arantiga_govern.014.d:0 "They kneel before the throne, they praise the emperor's rule, they bow to him... but Arantigos sees it in their eyes — they do not really respect, nor fear him. Nobles believe, that their blood gives them rights greater than those of an heir to the dynasty that reigned for sixteen centuries. They plot and scheme in their mansions, hoping to regain their lost power, to outmaneuver the "upstart baron" and reclaim what is "rightfully theirs". They never truly accepted and will never accept the new reality. But their time is gone. They are, however, not powerless yet — they can still be a threat. Perhaps it would be best to get rid of them — strip them of their titles and remaining privileges — there will be only the emperor and his subjects... But could there be another way? During the war there were many, who proved themselves worthy, who deserve to be put above the masses..."

arantiga_govern.015.d:0 "As dust settles, the Arantigan Empire emerges as a firmly established dominant superpower of Griffonia. The end to our conquests is coming, now we can finally stop concentrating on making tanks and planes. As military production takes up less resources, the civilian industry is starting to expand. Pirates and bandits were defeated and hostile fleets sank — the merchants can finally safely reach Griffonia and, in fact, international trade is starting to flourish once again. We could benefit from that and open our borders to trade... However, in that scenario, our fledgling industry would have to compete with much better-established foreign companies, perhaps, it would be better if we limited our imports to let our economy properly recover from years of war and chaos?"

arantiga_govern.016.d:0 "As our conquests progressed, dealing with increasing numbers of prisoners of war was becoming harder and harder. Captured officials, nobles, republicans and many other people filled our labour camps to the brim. Some of them were conscripted into penal battalions and perished on various battlefields, but there is still a huge amount of prisoners who are being held in various work camps. As the influx of them became smaller in recent times, our administration finally managed to dedicate time to properly check what the prisoners, who are still alive, we're holding captive for. Apparently, a lot of them are working away in labor camps for very minor crimes, some were convicted by mistake during wartime chaos, and the most rabid enemies of the state have already been executed. Perhaps, we could offer a "fresh start" to everyone, who does not seem to be a threat — of course we can be more picky and free only those, who are for sure properly reeducated, and those, who fell victim to overzealous protectors of the Empire."

Thanks to the might of Arantigan legions, we conquered Griffonia, griffons come back to their normal life, they start to forget about war, and so we're facing a risk of dissent. We purged the Empire of most troublemakers, but we are not closed nation — creatures, goods, and worst of all, ideas travel. Of course we wil lemploy education and propaganda to ensure that griffons remain firm supporters of our divine emperor - however, we will always have to confront foreign republican and communist preachers with their media. They smuggle revolutionary literature, like the equestrian "Friendship Journal" or Caramel Marks' works on communist theory, into our country. Although many of these books are forbidden be printed, sold, and owned in The Empire, we are starting to face organised attempts to sow dissent by immigrants and governments hostile to The Empire. Therefore, it is necessary to create The Ministry of Information, that will properly censor foreign works, decide what can be published in Empire and supress foreign attempts to undermine our regime. This will not eliminate the problem entirely, but we will gain some degree of control. But there is another option, we could implement a more radical solution — eliminate all non state-owned media and forbid publishment of all foreign works, except for those, approved by The Ministry."

Both the economy and the judiciary sustem were rebuilt specifically to allow Dorotheos to continue his conquests. Effectively, every citizen was a soldier — either fighting on the front, or working for it. Now, the great goal had been achieved — Griffonia was united under the rule of Arantigos the Second, who has already surpassed both his great ancestor and the Grovers. Griffons or Arantiga deserve to enjoy the fruits of their victory. Removing most burdensome policies and demobilizing the economy will earn the Emperor gratitude of his subjects and let Arantiga move into a new golden age of prosperity... But we are still surrounded by many hostile states, therefore, staying prepared for new possible conflicts at least for a few more years would ensure our safety..."

arantiga_govern.019.d:0 "There were many ancient ruins on the arantigan hills. Some of these structures were built even before the days of Arantigos the First. Although merciless time and scavenging masons turned most of them into shapeless piles of rubble, those, still surviving, got turned into monuments by the order of Dorotheos. All, except one — the old temple of Boreas in the middle of a vast forest has never been visited by tourists or archeologists. Officially it stood on the land of a royal hunting reserve, restricted only to Dorotheos. He has never visited it until now. When he and Margareth were both children, they used to play in this forest, pretending to be heroes of old stories... These were good memories. And this temple would be a good place for eternal rest. In the old necropolis, surrounding the temple, there was one new gravestone — no name on it, only a coat of arms of house Featherin. After inspecting the old temple, Dorotheos understood why his sister had wanted to be buried here. It was... peaceful.\nThe old griffon sat on one of the crumbling monuments, listening to singing birds. He has never visited Margareth’s grave before... but now, when decades passed, and the fire, that had once burned in his soul, started to fade, it felt like the right time to visit her.\nHe recalled old memories of his childhood, days when he was happy, when he was thinking about the greatness, he wanted to achieve, when the future seemed bright. He had stopped being the "young conqueror" long ago, and now he felt empty... Millions feared him, tens of millions worshipped him. In every town there was at least one monument to Arantigos the Second, in every temple griffons prayed to portraits of him. There was no greater conqueror and probably there will never be one. Griffonia was in peace, memories of wartime atrocities were fading. But when Dorotheos closed his eyes, he could see burning cities, hear screams of dying griffons. An entire generation of arantigans died to fulfill his ambitions. His old comrades were dead — replaced by sycophants and modern technocrats. This was his legacy, an empire that his descendants would inherit, an empire built on a foundation of death and suffering.\nNever again has Arantigos the Great spoken to him, and as years passed, Dorotheos started to have second thoughts. He feared death, when he would have to face the gods — will he be welcomed among them, or treated as an usurper? He gave one last look to the gravestone and recalled his sister's last words, "Was it worth it?" After all these years..."

"Establish formal relations between The Riverlands and The Arantigan Empire to usher in a new age of peace and prosperity for both nations". Considering his reputation of an unstable madgriff, a merciless conqueror, and a city-destroying barbarian, expecting pigs to learn to fly was more reasonable than expecting him to propose us this! Yet, he actually did it. Many suspect that this is a part of an elaborate plan to invade us, but what if this is a legitimate proposition of lasting peace?"

Dorotheos was the first griffon, who overpowered them. When his legions marched east, Lake City, Rijekograd, and even the proud city of Nimbusia were taken from the ponies, the whole continent is now united under the rule of Arantigos the Second. The time to celebrate has not come yet though — the eastern ponies are a stubborn bunch and they are not going to surrender this easily. Titoist partisans are attacking our patrols in the countryside, and remnants of riverpony armies are waging guerilla warfare. It may take years before we eradicate resistance and firmly establish our rule over the East. Some businessgriffs are already planning on exploiting untapped resources of the newly acquired eastern lands, but it may be more costly than beneficial. Instead of having to constantly suppress riverpony nationalism and deal with greedy investors, it could be easier to give ponies autonomy within The Arantigan Empire, delegating the burden of dealing with all this mess to the local government."

Not even The Griffonian Empire dared to challenge the princess of Equestria and reclaim this rightful piece of griffon soil. Now however, when the equestrian influence waned, we easily conquered New Mareland and eliminateed the potential threat of pony invasion. It is time to decide the fate of ponies. The simplest option is full annexation — there is plenty of local griffons who are more than happy to get rid of pony dominance and can help us govern this area. But this will probably cause significant immigration of ponies into our other domains and spread of their ideology of harmony. To keep them more under control, we could create an autonomous state, ruled by local griffons, and let them deal with this issue. However, some of New Mareland ponies are quite willing to cooperate with is, if we let them keep their influence — their representative, the former governor Jet Set, approached us, offering his services..."

Our army bases and police departments in the region are besieged by hordes of armed griffons, who are chanting Arantigos' name and awaiting his imminent arrival. Intelligence claims, that his army in the north is preparing to attack us, and some of our generals suggested we abandon these lands and build up our defense line deeper in franmistrian territory."

Not so long ago however, Wingbardy conquered the capital of Falcor, and defeated their thirst for revenge.

King Dorotheos proposes an alliance between our nations, promising us glory and a chance to reconquer our rightful lands from Wingbardian claws. The army of Arantiga is without doubt a powerful force and with their support we should be more than able to rival Wingbardy, but Dorotheos could be an unreliable ally — he has already betrayed the previous ruler of Arantiga, his own sister, and his sanity is questionable — recently he proclaimed himself Arantigos reincarnated.

One of these generals, Giovanni Gesse, unexpectedly requested a meeting with Dorotheos. The king had a chance to meet Gesse a few years before, during joint Karthin Pact maneuvers and was quite impressed by his skills, and for a short time they exchanged letters, discussing matters of military strategy. Gesse claimed that he is willing to swear fealty to Arantigos and recognise him as the new ruler of Wingbardy. In fact, many griffons would be willing to work for us, and Gesse can clawpick some talented officers that can be convinced to join the arantigan cause. For sure many common soldiers will be willing to leave the work camps to fight for their new ruler. As we conquer more and more lands, we will be forced to rely on auxiliary forces, recruited outside of our homeland. But currently many officers oppose the idea of letting a former Wingbardian general fight for us and doubt if he can be trusted — accepting his proposition will put a strain on relations with our military..."

arantiga.085.d:0 "Entering Dorotheos' office felt relieving. Its humble appearance greatly contrasted grandiose decorations of the rest of the palace, really the only thing reminding about the high status of its owner was a large marble bust of Arantigos the Great. His descendant was sitting behind a sizeable desk made of carved wood. Beside him stood two guards, tracking every move of Nicolas, they were ready to kill him if he started threatening their ruler. \n\n   "Nicolas de Charbon, we presume?" Said Dorotheos and without waiting for response added, "You were on the list of Flowenians meant to be captured and placed in high security prisons, as potentially dangerous members of the old government. We were surprised when you turned yourself in willingly and requested an audience. So... Why?"\n\n   "It became obvious that sooner or later i would face the choice of either leaving Griffonia or getting captured. None of the choices suit me. I had some time to rethink past events, analyse recent military campaigns of Arantigan Legions, and I realised that Your Grace's victory is imminent".\n\nArantigos smiled slightly, but his eyes remained cold. There was something wrong with his eyes... They reminded Nicolas of those mad bishops, who preached their intepretations of holy texts, wholeheartedly believing in their every word — these were the eyes of a fanatic, totally invested in his cause.\n\n   "Go on". Said the white-feathered griffon.\n\n   "It is obvious that within the next few months, at worst a couple years, the rest of Griffonia will be conquered. I’m interested in finding my own place in this new reality — as Your Grace’s subordinate".\n\n   "And why would We accept a griffon who fought against us into our service? There are more than enough loyal Arantigans and foreigners, who have assisted us before".\n\n   "That’s simple. As you go along, it will become harder and harder to find competent griffons, Arantigos. The more lands you will conquer, the harder it will become for gifted griffons to get into your court. There are many conquests to come, for them you need experienced generals and governors, not some unfeathered fledgelings. And I assure you, that if given a chance I’ll prove myself useful for you".\n\nArantigos leaned back on his chair. According to the intelligence report, de Charbon could indeed be considered a talented commander, and a ruthless one. He needed such griffons. But the high command would surely be displeased with the news about a "cowardly flowenan" entering their ranks. And, more importantly — could he trust Nicolas?"

But most of Aquileians despise their new overlords, and the republicans are ready to exploit this resentment for their own benefit. Numerous rebel cells have already risen and are now plotting against us. Their terrorist attacks are occurring on an almost daily basis. We need to deal with Aquileian resistance, if we hope to maintain control. The simplest solution would be to crush and supress them with the use of our armed forces — large-scale military action and arresting all known and suspected republican supporters may eventually break the rebels. But some within our intelligence suggest a more careful approach — they can infiltrate the republican movement, turning them against each other and then getting rid of those who remain."

Even though many considered their new ruler no more than a foreign warlord, their curiosity was strong. Without any doubt, this was the day, that would be remembered for many decades — the day, when a new empire was created. The ceremony started in the Temple of Boreas (now Temple of Arantigos-Boreas), where Dorotheos took an imperial crown from the claws of the newly appointed archon and crowned himself. The coronation ceremony was followed by a military parade. Military standards of defeated armies were carried along the symbols of the new empire, and veterans of countless campaigns marched through the streets. When Dorotheos finally arrived to the Imperial Palace, high-ranking officers, government officials, various nobles, and priests all knelt before him and swore fealty to their divine emperor. For the first time in many years Dorotheos smiled in delight. All these years of war, all these sacrifices... And now here, in the palace, he stood, having surpassed his great ancestor. He looked at griffons, all bowing to him, some from respect, others — from fear, and said: \n\n “For generation chaos reigned in Griffonia. For generations false kings and decadent emperors ruled over griffons. Gods turned away from us. These were dark days... But today a new era begins. No longer shall griffons bend to foreigners, no longer shall we be divided. With rebirth of Arantigos, Griffonia will be reborn too reforged with blood and steel, cleansed with fires of war. Arantiga achieved glory... Eternal glory, that will last till the end of the world, as will our new Empire!""

Nothing was in vain, because now Arantigos rules the greatest country on Griffonia... Or at least tries do it. During years of expansion our bureaucracy was becoming more and more inefficient and finally its problems have reached critical mass and the central government is no longer able to properly deal with outer provinces. Luckily, the might of Arantigan Legions prevents open rebellion, but the fact is, we cannot properly govern all these lands, inhabited by numerous griffons of various nationalities and religions. The threat of revolution is once again looming on the horizon, our military governors act like barbaric warlords and our lack unity is starting to backfire. If we want The Empire to survive, it will be crucial to address multiple dire issues — and do it fast, before our numerous enemies come together and attack us!"

"Arantigos". For most nobles Dorotheos seemed just an ambitious upstart, an eastern warlord they can play with and fool with promises of power and prestige that came with a royal marriage. The queen and her lackeys believed in the sweet words of arantigan diplomats too easily, ignoring even the obvious fact that Dorotheos was clearly a megalomaniac madgriff — they believed that this whole "godhood" thing was just a fool's play for common griffons. But Rodier knew better, he had carefully studied intelligence reports about Featherin's campaigns and knew, that his enemy was a cunning strategist. Aquileia was his next target. There were some disturbing signs of that. Clearly arantigan agents were trying to infiltrate the Aquileian command structure with the help of blackmail and bribes. Marechal has been gathering evidence for some time and now he was ready to unveil the plot meant to destroy his beloved Aquileia... He only needed to ask for a meeting with the queen and then...\n\n...No one has ever found out what would happen then. Unfortunately this day Rodier's office exploded — and the commander-in-chief of Armee de Aquilea died in an "act of terrorism conducted by a republican cell".

Population, long brutalised by Ferdinand’s soldiers, forgot for a moment that in fact not much has changed in their situation — it was just another oppressor, who was ruling them now. When the former dictator of the Griffonian Empire was brought to the gallows, crowds screamed and cursed him, and when he was finally executed, griffons started to celebrate. As Dorotheos watched cheering griffons from his tribune he recalled events of the last days. It was really hard to capture Dawnclaw – as he probably intended to die in combat, however soldiers were specifically instructed to capture him alive. When in prison, the Lord Protector seemed indifferent to what was happening around him – as if all of his will to live and ambition that was driving him were gone. When Dorotheos showed up, to thank him for “the last favor”, Dawnclaw unknowingly had done for him, the general just slightly grinned and said: “I must say it is actually a good plan. I will book you a place in hell.” As Featherin watched the execution, he was thinking about proclamations that would follow this day – “Dorotheos avenged the last Grover, saving the Empire from madgriff's claws”...It is good to have a scapegoat to hide your crimes – and Ferdinand was a perfect one."

"The poison is indistinguishable even for the best of physicians. The victim will appear to have died of an unexpected illness. Now, what about the payment?" Dorotheos raised his claw, "Yes, Yes, approximately one million idols, as agreed upon. paid in precious minerals, gems, and crystals as requested. Is it safer than cash?" The Zebra simply smiled. "Nowadays governments rise and fall, currencies are shaky! But gems are eternal". \n\n When the alchemist departed, Dorotheos once again looked at the vial lying upon his desk. He hired the zebra poisoner famous in the criminal underground for his extraordinary skills. Or so he thought. But he didn't doubt that the striped death dealer had held up his part of the bargain, in his business one could be either honest or dead, deception was impossible. \n\n All was accounted for, unicorns had certain crystals, which could extinguish the life of those, who touched them in a few hours, the unwitting alchemist was paid with these crystals. The unicorn, they were purchased from, laid dead at the bottom of Lake Rumare. The only thing left was to start the last phase of the plan. \n\n The poison provided by the zebra induced the same symptoms as the Grey Fever, a disease taht has been pestering devastated Griffenheim since its subjugation, but it led to a much quicker death. A group of carefully chosen zealously loyal griffons would help spread the disease to develop it into a full-scale epidemic. After that Grover would be poisoned. Amidst the chaos, caused by the epidemic, the death of one noble chick wouldn't seem strange, but to further cover up our involvement, after the end of their mission, our agents would be sent to the most dangerous places on the frontline, where they would perish and take the secret to the grave. \n\n King Arantigos recalled his meeting with the child-emperor. It happpened soon after his armies secured the Imperial City, young Grover was scared. Who wouldn't be? Arantigos was by this point one of the most renowned conquerors — he had defeated The Griffonian Empire. He'd get worried if the young griff wasn't afraid of him. Though at that point the child had witnessed so much cruety and death, he could have gone mad. But Arantigos was impressed, when the young no-longer-heir stood before him, trying to look as calm and presentable as possible. This must have been the worst day in his life. \n\n  For a brief moment Dorotheos wavered. But he knew — there can be only one Emperor."

Barely a month passed after the last enemy regiment in the city had surrendered. And now Griffenheim’s citizens were starting the hard work of rebuilding their damaged homes and neighborhoods. Slowly but surely the city would be rebuilt. \n\n Today, however, was not the day for rebuilding. Dorotheos, Arantigos reborn, decreed that on this day all citizens of the ruined city must attend the grand sparlean Triumph, a traditional ceremony reinstated, it signified a conqueror taking authority over his new lands. \n\n Small Arantigan flags flew in the slight breeze, tied to the black lampposts of the city. The Triumph took its route from Romau Plaza, along the Griffking Boulevard, wide as the river it was named after, to end at Zentralplatz near the Imperial Palace. Bridges over the Griffking River, destroyed by the defenders of Griffenheim, were a sad sight to behold, making Dorotheos’ glorious appearance look grotesque. \n\n As Dorotheos’ car passed through the streets, citizens of the city were waving flags and cheering. Many were forced to do so. Outside this display, most griffons looked sullen and defeated, resigned to their fate. They were only hoping that their lives wouldn’t change for the worse under their new ruler."

Initially Dorotheos suspected that message must have been an elaborate trap and immediately ordered to check it for any possible magical curses and more mundane means to kill him like poisonous chemicals. Thorough research revealed that the letter was not dangerous in any way. It’s contents however were interesting... The archon congratulated Arantigos with his recent victories and suggested that he would be willing to cooperate with the new ruler of Herzland and continue his work as the archon of Eyr helping to cement Dorotheos' rule. It is obvious that Erion just hopes to keep what little influence and wealth he has, but he is known as an extremely ambitious and untrustworthy griffon. Without doubt he is a shrewd politician and a legitimate archon. His support may prove valuable if we wish to be treated as more than just conquerors. But we will have to keep an eye on him."

When Arantigan Legions approached Karthin, morale was high and a fierce attack on the city began. Arantigan officers weren't concerned with losses of either side, neither did they care about the damage done to the city. Arantigos promised the highest decoration — The Order of Two Swords — to anyone, no matter the rank, who would manage to hang the arantigan flag from the top of Talonuels' palace. This led to a race between several units, which went deep into the city and headed straight for the royal palace, facing harsh resistance from its defenders. The race was won by the squad of sergeant Eigoros, with him and his junior sergeant Kantaros attaching the arantigan flag to the face of the building. Arantigos personally decorated the two and their commanding officer and offered them to join his personal guard. Soon after it, the last defenders of the city were defeated and the city surrendered in that, avoiding further damage. While most civilian districts were left in a moderately good shape, arantigan soldiers, following the orders of their ruler, demolished all symbols of the Wingbardian Kingdom. Statues of kings were broken, palaces cleared of all portraits and other items, representative of the former regime."

Retreating defenders of imperial capital destroyed by themselves many vital elements of city infrastructure to delay arantigan advance. Civilian losses are tremendous and it may take years before we will be able to rebuild city."

Thanks to the local government declaring it an open city and subsequently surrendering it to Arantiga, the capital of Aquileia was left relatively unscathed. The arantigan army marched through Promenade des Ducs. When arantigan soldiers entered the city, they were so dazed by its riches, they began plundering it. For several days locals were getting robbed of their possessions, before gendarmerie managed to suppress these groups of deserters. Units that maintained discipline were dispatched to protect aquilan landmarks, especially the temples of Trinity Hill. However, to great disgust of the locals, by the initiative of most fervent legionary chaplains, the temple of Boreas was decorated with large arantigan banners and portraits of Arantigos and renamed into the temple of Arantigos-Boreas."

They were supposed to discuss matters of military cooperation between Arantigan Legions and the Aquileian Royal Army. In reality, the discussion was more of a list of demands, and Rodier barely controlled himself not to order this eastern upstart to be thrown out of his office. It didn't take long before Arantigans started to treat Aquileia as their own backyard — various "diplomats" and "advisors" were almost openly interfering in internal Aquileian politics, and the royal government was being easily manipulated. Apparently, lured by promises of power and reign over Griffonia they followed this "Arantigos" helping him in his mad conquest of Griffonia. They foolishly believe that they are those who are playing him fool, instead, they are getting slowly entangled in a web of bribes, blackmail, and intrigue. If something would not be no later than in the following months, Aquileia would be free only in name. Something had to be done. Rodier needed to act. High ranking officers will follow him, and then overthrowing the queen would not be hard. He called for his adjutant and ordered him to visit the generals, Rodier knew were also dissatisfied with the current state of affairs.

The government collapsed, and after a few hours, almost all Aquileian soldiers declared fealty to the "Saviour of Aquileia". Officails of the deposed regime, including queen Vivienne, that avoided arrest, have already arrived in Arantiga, but now are virtually powerless.

Whoever designed this typical south griffonian building clearly loved vast courtyards and gardens, where its inhabitants could rest during the hottest hours of the day. Now it was occupied by visitors, who had to spend countless hours, waiting for an audience. But it was impossible for Nicolas to relax here — although everything seemed peaceful, he couldn't escape the eyes of many guards, monitoring the place for suspicious activity. Gardeners and servants seemed a bit too curious, they clearly were also a part of the internal security. What a crazy place... But being paranoid probably was justified for the owner, especially considering rumors of a recent coup attempt. During the next couple of hours Nicolas was notified several times that the king would talk to him shortly... But the invitation itself was not coming. Bored, he turned his attention to a fresco, that appeared to have been recently added to one of the walls. It depicted Dorotheos or, as he wanted to be called now, "Arantigos" as a lawgiver in fashion, typical to paintings of Boreas. Judging by this piece, the artist, who painted it, was quite decent, but Nicolas wondered if it was their own idea to glorify the ruler, or "Arantigos" himself requested to be depicted in this half-grandiose, half-heretical way. This wasn’t the only manifestation of the king's vanity he saw inside the palace alongside relics and works of art, clearly brought here as trophies from conquered nations. \n\nMore time passed, Nicolas was growing more and more irritated, deep in his thoughts he reminded himself why he was here — Flowena has fallen, and arantigan legions were marching through the West. Arantigos was carving his way to the ultimate victory, but Nicolas was sure, that even he beat all his enemies, his empire would not outlive him. Built on blood and fear, fueled by conquests, it would collapse right after its creator died, be it from claws of assassins, in another war, or due to old age... And then Flowena would be ready to rise once again. Perhaps de Charbons — Nicolas himself or his children — would lead his beloved city into the future. But for that to be possible, he needed to become a powerful griffon within Arantigos' realm — someone able to protect Flowena from dangers of this new age. This was why he had to clench his claws, bow to this wanna-be god, and serve him... \nSuddenly, he was pulled out of his thoughts by one of the servants,"

"Er, about that...The project cannot continue." \n\nHeinrich paused, and looked curiously at the pony. He put his clipboard on the desk, and paid rapt attention to what Bright Glow was saying.\n\nBright Glow continued, "Our research has hit a hurdle, and we are unable to continue further. We are hitting blocks in places we have never even predicted, and every solution we come up with seems to not work. There is no other way forward. Which means that the project has failed entirely."\n\nHeinrich looked blankly at Bright Glow, before the realisation hit him. "That...sucks. Arantigos certainly will certainly not be happy. Money, after all, does not grow on trees. You'd better make yourself scarce, my friend. Arantigos does not take lightly to failure."\n\nBright Glow nodded, "My and my colleagues have already prepared for this eventuality. We are to have disappeared by tomorrow."\n\n"Good, good. Knew you guys were always a smart lot. This may be last time we meet each other, so good luck on your journey, Bright Glow."\n\nThe pony and the griffon stood up, and Heinrich watched as Bright Glow disappeared into the corridor.

Initially, the operation's main goal was to simply recover as much research as possible, but as the salvagers got further into the the remains of the buildings, they began finding griffons and ponies who had, in fact, survived the explosion. After digging for at least two days, they unearthed the second-in-command of Gotterhammer, and a personal friend of Bright Glow, Antoine.\n\n"I...I do not know what really happened. I had been up working the whole night prior, so my head really ached." As if to prove his point, the griffon massaged his head. "I really do not remember much. But today was the day when Bright Glow would finally test his theory of liquified magical energy, and I do remember a lot of apprehension around my colleagues. Apparently they were worried about the impurities in the crystals, and how those impurities would increase the volatility of the whole reaction. Ugh...I was there too, but my head began aching a few moments before," he gestured to the ruins. "I excused myself, and one of the assistants took over my place. I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face, and suddenly...I was buried under concrete."\n\nFrom the ruins, a sizable amount of research would be recovered, but with the Gotterhammer team - save for Antoine - dead, the project has been shut down."

Griffons were largely unable to fully utilise the their potential due to their limited magical abilities. However with our conquest of Aquileia, we also have gained a substantial number of talented pony scientists. With their help, we could push forward our own nuclear research program and hopefully create a magical-nuclear bomb - or nuclear bomb for short - long before our enemies will be able to. Of course, given our earlier status as a mere vassal to the Wingbardian king, our nuclear program is near non-existant, which means that we will have to utilise the has already been done by the countries that we have previously conquered.\n\nOf all the nuclear programs that Aquileia had been running, one in particular has grabbed our attention, because it is not developing a mainstream nuclear bomb, and because it has had the futhest progress out of all of them - not that there has been much progress. Lead by a prominent unicorn physicist from the University of Aquila, Bright Glow, their team proposes a rather unorthodox theory. Traditionally, scientists have theorised that such a bomb would be powered using magical crystals and uranium, with the uranium serving as a integral catalyst. Meanwhile, Bright Glow theorises that under the right conditions, the power contained within the crystals becomes fluid, and can be transfered as necessary, without the need for a complex megaspell framework or a potentially carcinogenic catalyst. This has lead to the project gaining immense interest from the Aquileian government, and now they will work on their project under ours."

When the Chief heard it, he understand why Bright Glow went to all the trouble to make sure it went to him directly; it was quite ridiculous. Apparently, the team at Gotterhammer has recently recieved test results that are widely disperersed. It apparently was caused by a rarely-documented aspect of magical transfer that only comes into effect in a very specific environment.\n\nBright Glow was certain that while a detailed explanation existed for such a mechanism, it did not exist in any griffon archives, and he was right. So he took on it himself to search for knowledge he needed, and after contacting colleagues across Griffonia, he was able to ascertain the existence of a book, and indeed, the exact page, that described, the phenomenon that had the Gotterhammer team stumped. The one problem: it was Equestrian property, and they still held strict restrictions on who was allowed to read such books. A few phone calls by the Chief had confirmed this, and it appeared that the only way to get this knowledge would be to steal it, as fanciful as it seems, is the only way to aquire such knowledge.

A car would idle as close as possible to the window, ready to race off into the horizon, with the book to be delivered to Gotterhammer via the Arantigan Consulate in Canterlot.\n\nIt went like clockwork. They parked outside of a busy bar and waited for the hour of midnight before going ahead with the plan. Wearing black overalls and carrying a lockpicking set, Albert flew up high to a window on the 45th floor of the castle, and began work on breaking and entering. What they hadn't counted on was the window being fully maintained, such was the efficiency of the Equestrian administration, and in the end Albert had to force his way in. The Library was helpfully color-coded and cross-referenced, and it took no time for Albert to find what he was looking for. He made for the window, but collided with a Royal Guard who had been awakened when Albert broke the glass window. Luckily, he was too sleepy to aim or spell properly, and Albert managed to knock him out after a 'brief' struggle.

According to his explanation, the crystals will not be compatible with other crystals if they are too impure, so they have to be absolutely free of impurities. To that extent, he has recommended a few crystals that are owned by a prominent Aquileian collector. He has approached the griffon personally, but he does not want to sell.

This means that there is a very high chance of a...accident occuring." Seeing Heinrich's alarm, Bright Glow quickly attempted to allay his concerns, "There's no danger! We always follow the most stringent safety routines, and I'd trust everyone at Gotterhammer with my life. But, the volatility of such a liquid bomb would negate the need for a complicated detonation mechanism, so that simplifies exploding it I guess. Anyways, now that we are moving to larger crystals with more magical power stored, I just thought it would be prudent to move research somewhere more...remote."\n\n"You have somewhere in mind? I hear the Scheisswald's perfect this time of year!" said Heinrich, chuckling.\n\nBright Glow, meanwhile, had a serious look on his face, "Exactly what I was thinking. It's remote, and already has extensive crystal mines, which would help logistics. Building some infrastructure there would really hurt would it? The remote location also ought to allay those 'security concerns' that those folks over at Il Servizio Segreto keep raising at our monthly meetings."\n\nNow that Bright Glow had explained his reasoning, the move to the Scheisswald does not seem as ridiculous as it had..."

This decision would turn out to save thousands of lives in our capital.\n\nBright Glow and his colleagues had severely underestimated instability of liquidified crystals. Soon after the crystals were prepped for the energy transfer, the magical control field surronding the crystals were overwhelmed by chaotic and uncontrollable magical energies. At least, that is what our investigators believe happened, after spending days combing through the prior reports made about project, and studying large crater that was left after the explosion that obliterated a substantial part of Scheiswald Forest and several nearby settlements. Apparently, the explosion only occured now, after months of experimentation, because the purity of the crystals played a big role in reducing volatility. But, in the end, even the most pure crystals in the world could not prevent the eventual explosion. The explosion was even reportedly heard in Griffinheim, where the population was not convinced by the hastily prepared explanation; that the incident was the result of the unleashing of an ancient spell by group of prospectors...Strangely enough, the area affected by liquid crystal explosion was soon covered in large quantity of crystals deposits. The project will be shut down due to the proved inability to control the liquid crystal. Still, our...remaining nuclear scientists believe that we can use some of results, but apparently the Liquid-C bomb project has reached a dead end."

The fire department had had to spend hours preventing the fire from spreading, and they have decided to chalk up the costs to the IRI. After seeing the state of the firefighter, Ferrucio put up no resistance. When he had left, Ferrucio wondered about the cause of the fire. His guess would later become the official explanation, that the Maarites burnt their work to prevent it being used against them in the investigation.

Currently, the best forms of treatment are magical in nature, and that is why Equestria has a much better system of healthcare than most of Griffonia. Excepting the need for a magician aside, it takes years before a spell is out that can cure novel diseases.\n\nA group of researchers from the University of Greenback have proposed creating a magically-altered microbe. This microbe will constitute a so-called 'universal cure' that can cure any disease, regardless of age, severity, and lethality. The team also voices the possibility that this microbe will be able to cure cancer, and other genetic disorders.\n\nAlthough this invention will have a massive impact on the civilian sector, we are mainly concerned with cutting attrition in disease-rife areas and improving our capabilty to withstand a bio-weapon attack in the future."

It just comes with their job."\n\n"Yes, I know! But these guys are different. They're not like the others. In all my years of work, I have never known a scientist who has deliberately refused aid that they themselves have asked for. Scientists who are pacificists are a dime a dozen these days, but these griffons are certainly not pacificists. They would not be at the IRI otherwise."\n\n"And how have they been 'refusing' our aid?"\n\n"Well, they have been taking the resources and funding we have given them, and they have made themselves at home in their lab, but they have absolutely refused anyone from the IRI entering their lab. Reports come onto my desk everyday, but none of us have ever seen the inside of the lab since before they got here. I've done some digging into the background, and it seems that most members of the Panaceum team have had connections to the prominent Maarite-"\n\n"Not you and your Maarite plots again!" cried the Chief. \n\n"-philospher Martin Zobrist." finished Ferrucio.\n\n"Zobrist? Wasn't he the guy who proposed that the world ought to be purged using a virus? And what's so bad with Maarites anyways?"\n\nFerrucio smilled, "Yes, Zobrist did indeed pioneer the Inferno theory, but he died a few years ago. My problem with Maarites is that their doctrine is that creatures need to die. Maar is, after all, the god of death, and he demands sacrifice. The team at Panaceum have access to most of Arantiga's biological stockpiles, and they could be very well creating the very disease we are trying to cure!"\n\nThe chief sighed, "If you think it is best, I'll prepare a official investigation into the team..."\n\n"But they'll know!" cried Ferrucio.\n\n"Well, what do you think I should do?

It is a regular occurance when a project runs out of money, even more so for scientific ventures. This is why the IRI always has a significant back-up fund for projects like this one. Except this one has not needed much money at all. I just checked yesterday, and the warehouse has been stripped clean of every single piece of equipment. Not a single Petri dish or swab remained, and yet the reports on my desk indicate that work is going well. This naturally aroused my suspicion-"\n\n"Well of course you were aroused," quipped the Chief.\n\n"-And I decided to investigate. When they were out, I broke into their lab, and, as I suspected, it was fully stocked. I got the manufacterors name and got out of their before the Maarites arrived. Tracing the name led me to company that was owned by a suspected Maarite. Coincidence? I think not."\n\n"Ferrucio, this is getting ridiculous. Just because somebody says some is a Maarite does not mean that is actually a Maarite. Have you been to the tavern again?"\n\n"Haha, very funny." remarked Ferrucio.\n\n"Well, what would you have me do? It's either you let this slide or start an official investigation.

They, like the others, have been arrested by the police, who have refused to release them, citing dangers to civilians and the state. The police claim the best course of action would be to conduct an investigation into the IRI, and many in the organisation also feel that this is the best course of action.\n\nNormally, Ferrucio would be at the front of encouraging harsh action on Maarites, but he has toned it down, and instead proposed releasing the Panaceum team and then keeping a very close eye on them. He says he is concerned with the other Maarites who have escaped the raid, and that the Panaceum research is still not complete.

Allenstein was soaked up to his neck in blood, and his eyes and nose burnt from all the repulsive and poisonous chemicals needed in this operation. After taking a sip of water, his eyes began to rest on the subject. The brown griffon once known as Adalbert was no longer recognizable, his body a ravaged mess of feathers and ugly technology. Allenstein's eyes teared up at the though that Adalbert was gone; he was too young to die. Alas, there was nothing he could do. After thirty minutes of not breathing or moving, he surely was dead.\n\nAs was protocol, Allenstein reached to take the griffon's pulse, when Adalbert's claw suddenly grasped his outstrechted arm. His grip was so tight that Allenstein could only grimace in intense pain as his arm was broken. He barely heard Adalbert over his own screams. "Doc. Am I alright...?" Adelbert tried to speak before he collapsed from sheer effort . His grip on Allenstein loosened and he dropped to the floor with a thud, his blood pooling around him.\n\nLuckily, his assistants came in a few minutes later and hauled Allenstein to the infirmary.

If there was a lack of volunteers, there was more than enough convicts, which either way would end up executed.\n\nBut finally, after months of work, the project was finished and Allenstein could present results. Arantigos was invited to watch maneuvers where groups of augmented veterans would fight his elite personal guard, the Companions. Each of Allenstein’s patients lacked at least one or more limb, and their crystal eyes glowed with baleful light, and alchemic implants pumped a mixture of stimulants when they charged the Companions. Arantigos and a small group of high-ranking officers were quite surprised when the Companions were quickly defeated, as the augmented soldiers easily crushed any resistance.

It will overload whole system!"\n\nBut before anyone could react, the device suddenly stopped buzzing, and then it exploded. Waves of light scorched everything it touched - machines, ponies and griffons, turning them all into dust. In a few seconds, everyone inside the facility was dead. When soldiers from the outside returned to investigate, they found only a single living being - a griffon in military uniform, who clearly was never part of the facility."

arantiga_decision.48.d:0 "The sole 'survivor' of Project Silver Key was immediately subject to interrogation. The results were nothing short of shocking. We discovered that this survivor was none other than Reiner Greenfeather, a high ranking officer of Reichsarmee...serving Emperor Grover V. When we crossed out the possibility of insanity, an analysis of the details of his story clearly indicate that he had come from another...timeline? dimension? Our scientists are still arguing about the name, but clearly, the world Greenfeather came from is much different from ours. In his world, the Empire did not collapse, and instead was engaged in brutal fighting with the River Empire. During one of the battles, Reiner's command post was attacked by an experimental unicorn spell, that instead of killing him, somehow linked with the Silver Key device and transported him here.\n\nAlthough his stories of things like the Equestrian king, Sombra, alicorn demons ravaging Equus and other more bizarre events will provide excellent material for novels, they are not very useful for us - and apparently the technology of his dimension was similar to ours. Project Silver Key will be shut down owing to the death of entire staff, including Ascarius himself - without him we are not able to rebuild the device. Aquileian magicians were later brought in, and, after analyzing what remained, were suprised that we have not caused a much greater magical disaster.\n\nAs for Reiner...After finding out he has no way to return home, he has offered his services to the Arantigan Empire instead."

arantiga_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In the last few years the lands of Central Griffonia became a place of brutal war, amidst the warfare rose a new powerful dominion — Arantiga. After a military coup its leader, Dorotheos Featherin, conquered many neighboring nations and proclaimed himself a king and Arantigos Reborn — the reincarnation of his famous ancestor, a great conqueror of antiquity. Having recovered the long-lost artifact — the Idol of Boreas — Dorotheos also changed holy rituals to praise himself together with Boreas. Neighboring governments issued protests, considering Dorotheos' act as a heretical attempt of usurping godhood and proof that the young conqueror has finally lost his mind..."

Although Skynavian forces managed to open a narrow land corridor from the city to the nearest port, the Red Army was ultimately unable to lift the siege after it began. After each assault the Legions would constantly be repelled leading to huge casualties on the attacking side while the Skynavian troops held the city with zeal never witnessed before, Emperor Dorotheos, realising that taking the city through constant assaults would take too long, ordered for all attacks on the city to be ceased, opting for saturated shelling with all artillery cannons available. By the time the bombardement was over, the entire city had been leveled and not a single survivor remained."

However, his madness did not hinder his military talent, and despite unfavorable odds he managed to conquer Herzland, Wingbardy, and Aquileia. Today, during a lavish ceremony in Griffenheim, Dorotheos crowned himself as the new Emperor of Griffonia.

### Leader Descriptions ###
generic_neutral_leader_desc:0 "Baroness Margareth Featherin has been ruling Arantiga for the past decade with a just and fair claw, but even she cannot deny that under her reign, there has been a decisive lack of progress as Wingbardian capitalists seized most of the Arantigan industry. However, she believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, and that Arantiga's current woes can be resolved with a few careful words, something her more notable brother and general in the army, Dorotheos, disagrees with."
literally_alexander_desc:0 "The younger brother of the former Baroness, Dorotheos Featherin has been yearning to learn about the Arantigan military as long as he could remember. He spent many hours in the national library perusing the tales of old Arantigos, how he had defeated armies more numerous than his, only to be felled by the plague after his latest conquest. Since then, Dorotheos has made it his life goal to join the Arantigan officer corps, with his brilliant mind astounding even the most senior leadership. His quick rise to success can be attributed solely to his capabilities, and once he was in position to reform the armed forces, he did so with great fervour, restoring some of their old glory. But this was not enough for Dorotheos, as he wished above all to restore the ancient Kingdom. The die was cast, and the coup was a success - he shall restore Arantiga's glory."
generic_harmony_birb_desc:0 "One of the many Wingbardian investors who made their fortune in Arantiga, Antioco Moro has made Arantiga his home. Smitten by the local culture and history, he has invested much of his profits into rebuilding Arantiga, and unlike his fellow capitalists, his workers had a fair paycheck and numerous benefits. The dreadful coup has almost destroyed his lifework, and he was one of the first to gather his political party for the elections, campaigning on the promises of a better, peaceful Arantiga. The populace have not forgotten his contribution to the society, and he now leads Arantiga to a brighter tomorrow."
another_nazbol_guy_desc:0 "Ciriaco Mediate leads the new Arantiga. He was content as a common soldier in the Arantigan army, proud of his state, but much changed after he read a particularly thought provoking manifesto. The Rozenkamp brothers' unique blend of socialism and nationalism great inspired him, and he began spreading his views within his battalion. Although some suspect he was covertly supporting Dorotheos in his failed coup, he dismissed all those claims, saying that the state must achieve balance between the patriots and the proletariat. Ciriaco's extreme ideology has found fertile ground in every aspect of Arantiga's society, even as some questioned its viability."
alexander_but_woke_desc:0 "Dorotheos Featherin has heard Boreas' instructions and he has taken them well. Having proclaimed himself the reborn Arantigos, he is set to fulfill his destiny and reestablish the ancient Kingdom. This he swears."

### Cosmetic ###
tungsten_desc:0 "Literally just a piece of tungsten. It was promoted in 1005 by Dorotheos as a way to poke fun at Nicator and as such, it has its own desk, uniform, salary, and right to be present in the general staff meetings."
soter_desc:0 "Soter Litori, the owl of Arantiga, was born in 980 in the forests south of Ponteles. One of the brightest mind of the Arantigan general staff, his upbringing in the boondocks gave him the skills to traverse the thick forests of Arantiga with ease, and teach others how to do it. This, along with his charisma and great loyalty to the state of Arantiga made him (at the time of his promotion at 26 years old) the youngest General in the Arantigan Army."
cassander_desc:0 ""Commando Cassander" as he's often called, is the Griffon in charge of the Divisione di Forze Speciali, also called "that place where money goes in and invisible griffons come out" by Dorotheos"
lysimachus_desc:0 "Lysimachus is the newest addition to the Arantigan General Staff. A fanatic admirer of Dorotheos, he probably knows more about the Field Marshal than his own mother ever did. Able to inspire soldiers to almost the same level of zealotry as him, he is in charge of recruiting the new generation of Arantigans into the army"
nicator_desc:0 "Nicator Whitebeak is second in both command and ego of the Arantigan army, after Dorotheos himself. Promoted by Duchess Margareth, Nicator is famous for his strategy of shelling the enemy to Tartarus, and being damn good at doing it too."
