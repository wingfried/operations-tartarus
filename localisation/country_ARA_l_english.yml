ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "From the stronghold of Romau, to the city of Midoria, and from the boulevards of Aquileia to the ricefields of Sydia stretched Arantigos' Empire. Arantigos 'the Great' they called him, for he never lost a single battle. Alas, he taken too soon, and his empire collapsed with death. Now, all that remains of his legacy is the Barony of Arantiga. With Arantiga in a state of decay, similar to the Rumarean Ruiniad, a young, fanatic army general sees himself as the only hope for his beleagured nation."

ARA_napalm_desc:0 "In a war, there can be no half measures. Either we are the victors, or we suffer a most ignoble defeat. Thus, our bombers will begin carrying a more devastating weapon - napalm. After all, they can't keep the war up if all their factories are in flames."
ARA_finest_aces:0 "The Finest Aces"
ARA_finest_aces_desc:0 "A superior training program will ensure only the best fly in our planes; our pilots will be the cream of the crop! In every aspect of warfare, Arantiga shall be at the very top!"
ARA_new_bombers:0 "Salt the Fields"
ARA_new_bombers_desc:0 "Regular bombers are good, but what we need are heavy duty warplanes; bombers that can take a beating and still survive to drop their payload. That is where the future of aeronautics lay."
ARA_new_closer_air:0 "Guard Our Troops"
ARA_new_closer_air_desc:0 "Coordination between air and land has clear tactical and strategic benefits; creating aircraft designs specifically to aid the boots on the ground will make them grateful for the wings above."
ARA_new_heavy_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction"
ARA_new_heavy_bombers_desc:0 "Bombing key enemy positions; supply depots, railways, you name it, will require specialized planes. Designing some should be a priority."

ARA_rumare_exercises:0 "Lake Rumare Exercises"
ARA_rumare_exercises_desc:0 "Arantiga lacks access to sea, however we border Lake Rumare and own a small flotilla of patrol boats. If we ever want to create an actual navy, perhaps we can start by conducting exercises here."
ARA_foreign_naval_doctrines:0 "Studying Foreign Doctrines"
ARA_foreign_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "We lack naval traditions and our knowledge of naval warfare is very limited. If we ever want to rival old coastal powers we need to emulate their designs and doctrines."

ARA_equus_invasion_training:0 "Equus Invasion Training"
ARA_equus_invasion_training_desc:0 "Although invasion Equus, the western continent, may never come, it is not a reason why we should not train for such scenario - there are many states there that clearly envy Arantiga and may try to act against us - let’s attack them first, before they can land on griffonian shores!"
ARA_arantigan_battleships:0 "Arantigan Battleships"
ARA_arantigan_battleships_desc:0 "Powerful and invincible battleships are true kings of naval warfare. With a fleet of them we will be able to defeat all of our enemies!"

#ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance_desc:0 "Arantiga's economy is in a pitiful state, and we must see to the matter of resolving this issue if we wish to become a regional power. The first task on the list is deciding our stance towards Wingbardy."
#ARA_our_own_way:0 "Our Own Path"
#ARA_our_own_way_desc:0 "Arantiga must forge its own path. If we do not make ourselves economically independent, we will be, beyond our obligations in the Pact, forced into wars with them. As such, it is time to begin cutting ourselves free from the claws of Wingbardy's industry."
#ARA_build_roads:0 "Arantigan Railroad"
#ARA_build_roads_desc:0 "If we are to become an industrial power, we will need the base infrastructure for it. Preparing ourselves for the great leap forward is a must if we are to be economically separate."
#ARA_industrial_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
#ARA_industrial_buildup_desc:0 "More factories can only benefit us. Therefore, it is logical we should center our efforts on expanding our industry. We shall give subsidies to a select number of companies."
#ARA_mining_operations:0 "Ores in the Hills"
#ARA_mining_operations_desc:0 "With the recent location of new metal deposits in Arantiga's hills, we can open up additional mines to secure more resources for our economy. Arantiga must be reliant on its own resource base, and not from foreigners."
#ARA_import_machinery:0 "Import Machinery"
#ARA_import_machinery_desc:0 "We will need tractors, trucks and other industrial machines to help fuel our growing industry. Purchasing some is an excellent solution to help us meet our material needs."
#ARA_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
#ARA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Not only will allowing foreign exports to examine our economy benefit it, they will also help with the pandemic illiteracy rampaging around our nation. Incentives, however, will be required to attract them to Arantiga. A small price for progress, nonetheless."

#ARA_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "With all our buildup, we can move ourselves away from our backward technology and into the age of industry proper!"
#ARA_transition_finished:0 "The Economy Reborn!"

#ARA_go_with_wingbardians:0 "Go With the Wingbardians"
#ARA_go_with_wingbardians_desc:0 "Our economy is already closely tied to Wingbardy. It only makes sense that we should therefore build up our ties and use them to our advantage. While this will, of course, make us dependent on Wingbardy, there are clear benefits to it as well."
#ARA_vinyards:0 "Expand Alubviran Vineyards"
#ARA_vinyards_desc:0 "Wine is a common luxury, enjoyed throughout Griffon lands and beyond. As such, it is in constant demand. Expanding our already present vineyards in Alubvira should help our economy prosper."
#ARA_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
#ARA_tourism_desc:0 "Tourism is a wonderful thing. Ponies, griffons and even zebras come to visit and marvel at the wonders of our achievements. Encouraging them so that they come to spend their money in our country, therefore, is an excellent way to bring more money into our economy."
#ARA_tax_incentives:0 "Invite Investors"
#ARA_tax_incentives_desc:0 "Investors will be needed to bring money and business into our growing economy. Inviting and offering incentives to them should allow our economy to blossom."

#ARA_cement_factories_desc:0 "Our nation, small as it is, is home to a wide variety of forests. From aging oaks to young maples, Arantiga has no lack of biodiversity. And yet we have scarcely utilised this natural resource. After deliberation with Wingbardian investors, we shall begin exploiting our forests, but for each tree felled, we shall plant two new ones. This prevents the erosion of the soil and preserves our natural beauty."
#ARA_industrial_assistance:0 "Request Industrial Assistance"
#ARA_industrial_assistance_desc:0 "Arrogance has to be a thing of the past; we must be humble if we seek to gain power to place ourselves on equal footing with Wingbardy. Requesting assistance to develop and transition our economy is therefore a must."
#ARA_cigars:0 "Pontels Cigar Factory"
#ARA_cigars_desc:0 "Cigars are an excellent investment; not only are they used constantly, but they are easy to produce and will keep the citizenry placated. Rumours of life expectancy tanking as a result of overuse are just exaggerations."

ARA_new_age_new_army_desc:0 "We are entering a new era of warfare. Gone are the days of the spear and shield. Here and now is the age of guns and tanks. In order to face the threats of the new millennium, both civilians and military personnel must be in perfect cooperation."
ARA_new_academy:0 "Meet with the Generals"
ARA_new_academy_desc:0 "Once, we were the greatest nation on Griffonia. The ancient military doctrines need to be adapted to modernity. Our officers need to be reinstructed with a mix of classic and modern works about warfare. After that, it is time to develop new doctrines, and adapt to the ever-changing ways of war. The question is: which of our generals will we listen to?"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine:0 "From Zebrica with Speed"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Craterus has arrived from Zebrica, and brings with him the wonders of tanks, jeeps, and trucks. While the trenches of old stand tall and strong, these mechanical beasts lumber forth, destroying all who dare stand in our way. It is clear that adopting such a doctrine will only benefit us in the long run."
ARA_develop_doctrine:0 "Lead from the Front!"
ARA_develop_doctrine_desc:0 "It is said Arantigos favoured to lead the mobile wing of his army from the front. He did not fear danger and neither should our officers. If we are to adapt the risky manoeuvres that come with our doctrine, we need to show the troops that our officers are not afraid to lead them into battle themselves!"
ARA_cult_of_speed:0 "A Cult of Speed"
ARA_cult_of_speed_desc:0 "Speed is the deciding factor in warfare. If you can decide where to fight and who you face when, you have already won half your battles. And if we can push forward faster than they can retreat, then our enemies have no chance against us."
ARA_actual_trucks:0 "Unit Motorisation"
ARA_actual_trucks_desc:0 "Armoured, motorised infantry is an ideal the Great Conqueror himself never had access to. If one unit can act both as a hammer and an anvil, exploiting gaps and keeping an enemy in place, we should make haste to reform our army into such a force."
ARA_tanks_for_the_army:0 "Knights of the New Age"
ARA_tanks_for_the_army_desc:0 "In the past, stalwart Knights adorned in great armour battled against beasts of legend and the enemies of their nations. Now, it is clear that these Knights, while inspirational, are quite outdated. We must adapt to the times, or be left behind."
ARA_better_tanks:0 "Rolling Out"
ARA_better_tanks_desc:0 "Our armoured behemoths are ready to go forth and destroy our enemies. The tank has been revealed as a great weapon of war, which can multiply the strength of an army in the hands of a great tactician. Our foes will find that Arantigan tanks will outmanoeuvre and outfight anything they can bring to the battlefield."
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine:0 "Blow them to Tartarus"
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Arantigos Featherin himself already appreciated the use of weapons with longer range then your opponents. Nicator's words ring true: they cannot pose a threat to us if they are dead before they get to us."
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine:0 "Safe and Sound"
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine_desc:0 "We will defeat the enemy safe and sound in our bunkers while our artillery rips them to shreds. None will stand in our way. There is no reason to throw away Arantigan lives without reason, since any Arantigan is worth ten times that of another soldier."
ARA_mass_artillery:0 "Massed Artillery Fire"
ARA_mass_artillery_desc:0 "Through the use of massed artillery fire, we shall not only annihilate the enemy's fighting spirit, but also wreck their defences. The following infantry charge will see little to no resistance. The Great Conqueror himself used this tactic to great effect, disorganising the enemy’s front line and then trampling over them with a charge."
ARA_better_artillery:0 "Modern Artillery Pieces"
ARA_better_artillery_desc:0 "The days of catapults and ballistae are but legends. Gone are the days of star-shaped forts and cannons. Technology marches forward unrelentingly and in this new age, we have howitzers and bunkers. We must make sure we keep up with all new developments."
ARA_fancier_guns:0 "Preparing the Vanguard"
ARA_fancier_guns_desc:0 "Having all these big guns are virtually useless if we do not have the means to protect them. Even with all these new weapons, the Arantigan soldier is still the mainstay of the army. We should ensure that he is equipped with the best weapons that money can buy."
ARA_continous_planning:0 "Dedicated Officer Core"
ARA_continous_planning_desc:0 "With our big guns now being the central philosophy of our army, we should ensure our officers are able to put them to use, as well as assigning officers to these artillery crews so they are more efficient."

ARA_new_school_desc:0 "The ancient Academy in our capital has become the domain of dust and paper rot! But with our officer corps in place, we can turn the old grounds into a bustling hub of military knowledge once again.

ARA_new_guns:0 "Guns For the Troops"

ARA_new_artillery_desc:0 " With these new massive guns, no enemy will be able to hide from our might. No pillbox, no trench, no fortification will be able to stand up to the salvos of our guns. We will force them to face us on even ground!"
ARA_new_equipment:0 "Sturdy Shovels"
ARA_new_equipment_desc:0 "An infantryman cannot defend himself if he has no hole to hide in. Improving our support equipment should be a priority. An Arantigan infantryman should be able to march for days while fully packed. Surely they can carry an extra shovel or first aid kit."
ARA_spec_ops_program:0 "Cassander's "Forze Speciali""
ARA_spec_ops_program_desc:0 "Unconventional warfare is the deadliest. Using new tactics, we can surprise our foes with special operations. We merely need to plan the way we will fight."
ARA_nation_under_arms:0 "An Armed Society"
ARA_nation_under_arms_desc:0 "Tensions are rising rapidly all around us. It is clear that we cannot afford to stand back and watch the world burn. We must arm ourselves. Once, the entire nation was mobilized for conquest and if necessary, we can militarise again."
ARA_prepare_the_people:0 "Is a Polite Society"
ARA_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "Our griffons will not need to stay home and protect their families. They can join the army, since they know that in a militarized society, all those who stay behind will be protected as well."
ARA_the_cadets:0 "The Giovani Cadetti"
ARA_the_cadets_desc:0 "The Cadetti are a branch of Arantigan military scientists, tasked with developing new weapons for the military. We should expand their ranks and make sure to also task them with civilian projects if necessary."
ARA_guerilla_warfare:0 "No Surrender"
ARA_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Surrender is the cowards’ path. We will fight to the death. Every last Arantigan will brave the perils of war, or die trying. The forests of Arantiga will be utilised for our partisan movement, with hidden equipment caches."
ARA_mandatory_training:0 "Implement Mandatory Military Training"
ARA_mandatory_training_desc:0 "We cannot afford for everygriff to remain a civilian. Everyone must be ready to be conscripted if it is needed. Therefore, all griffons should be trained in the ways of war, so that new recruits can quickly be prepared for combat, should the need arise."
ARA_radio_stations:0 "Military Frequencies"
ARA_radio_stations_desc:0 "If you know what your enemy is up to, you have already won half of the battle. Although spies remain important, new technologies will allow us to see the world far more clearly. We should make use of this."
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws:0 "Expand Conscription"
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws_desc:0 "Our military is quite small, and as such, we need a greater proportion of bodies watching the borders. Updating our conscription laws should serve to fix this issue nicely."
ARA_military_railroads:0 "Is a Functioning Society"
ARA_military_railroads_desc:0 "A militarized society should use military precision and drill for every aspect of life. Much more can be pushed out of our infrastructure if we enforce exact timetables and sober use of seating on trains. This will effectively increase our infrastructure’s capacity."
ARA_builder_divisions:0 "Divisioni di Lavoro"
ARA_builder_divisions_desc:0 "The Divisions of Labour are a group of military engineers. These engineers specialise in constructing and maintaining the industry and infrastructure of our nation, military and civilian. It is time to give them the support they need to be more effective."
ARA_reservist_housing:0 "Reservist Housing"
ARA_reservist_housing_desc:0 "Building more barracks for our troops will allow us to significantly expand our army. A soldier who knows he is well housed, will have one less thing to worry about besides fighting."
ARA_fortified_nation:0 "Hunker Down"
ARA_fortified_nation_desc:0 "Compared to quite a few, our army is small, but elite. As such, we must secure every advantage we can that will inflict greater losses on the enemy for less of ours. It is time to dig in."
ARA_stocked_arsenals:0 "Stock the Arsenals"
ARA_stocked_arsenals_desc:0 "We cannot fight if we do not have guns. We need to make sure everygriff in our army is supplied and ready. The cost of preparation is invaluable, and the troops will appreciate our efforts."
#ARA_mobilized_economy:0 "Mobilize the Economy"
#ARA_mobilized_economy_desc:0 "Our economy, while reasonable, is also mostly civilian. We must mobilize it and make it ready for war. A modern war is won on the homefront and if we are to win heroic victories, we should be supplied with legendary weaponry."

ARA_welfare_state:0 "Benessere"
ARA_welfare_state_desc:0 "Arantigans are a proud people who never ask for much, but it is undeniable there is a section of society that subsists on far less than they should have.

ARA_educate_the_poor_desc:0 "Our education program is solid, but there are still some griffons who have never received proper schooling due to their destitute situation. An improvement to this situation is in order, and we aim to completely eliminate illiteracy in the next five years."
ARA_foreign_investors:0 "Foreign Investments"
ARA_foreign_investors_desc:0 "We have done much to improve our economy in the past year, but there is still much to do, and we cannot do it on our own. Tax breaks and subsidies should encourage wealthy foreigners to invest in Arantiga."

ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness_desc:0 "The Baroness, while a noble, still ruled us well for many years. Cooperating with her would not only turn the conservatives to our side, but would increase our legitimacy as well."

ARA_a_rolemodel_desc:0 "Look at us now, a proper rolemodel for Griffonian Harmony.

arantiga.1.d:0 "As a small nation in southern Griffonia, Arantiga has never had the best of economies. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed, and Arantiga truly became independent, the situation worsened.\n\nBut not all seemed lost. Arantiga united with the Wingbardians to our south, and joined the Karthinian Pact in hopes of defending against aggressors and rebuilding its economy.\n\nSadly, Wingbardy used their ever growing influence over us to profit from our weakened economy. This has become a massive issue in Arantigan politics, seeing as how Wingbardian entrepreneurs and companies seize a majority of the profits made.\n\nThe question has yet to answered. How will Arantiga continue on? Will we cut ties with the Wingbardians, and strive to become economically independent from them? Or will we try and simply lower their influence, in an attempt to minimise the cons and maximising the pros of their economic 'assistance'?"

arantiga.2.d:0 "Today was the day Dorotheos had been waiting for.\n\nIt was just shortly after two in the afternoon, and it seemed as if half of Sparleto was up in arms. Together with his followers, Dorotheos plowed his way through the capital city, all the way to the government district. There, the first shots were exchanged between loyalist police forces and soldiers. As the battle in the streets began to flare up, Dorotheos and his personal guard managed to breach the defenses, and entered the House of Government.\n\nMargareth stood in front of the window in her office, observing the battle. She had already called for reinforcements when she heard the first reports of the possible coup, but for now, their defences would need to hold.\n\nSuddenly, the door to her office was busted open, and as Margareth turned around, she saw her own brother, revolver in his claw, approaching her. She walked backwards, hitting the window behind her. Dorotheos armed his revolver as Margareth closed her eyes, praying to the gods.\n\nJust as he is about to pull the trigger, voices sound from outside the office, getting closer and closer, to the point where they're just around the corner."

She held back the tears, at least for the moment, but she, and most likely everyone else in the courtroom knew that he was guilty, and that there was no hope in Boreas that he'd come out alive.\n\nThe trial itself did not take long. There were mountains of evidence, including witnesses, the many dead bodies in the streets of Sparleto and, last but not least, Margareth herself, whom he had tried to kill in person before her soldiers overwhelmed and arrested him.\n\nThe judge was cold, but only did his duty as he announced that Dorotheos was guilty as charged. Treason of the highest order. The punishment was none other than death.\n\nAs the guards dragged a grim-looking Dorotheos out of the courtroom, and past Margareth, she couldn't help but finally break out into tears."

Dorotheos  had ambitions, ambitions of restoring Arantiga, and today was the day he'd set in motion his plans of realizing those ambitions.\n"So generals, are we in agreement?" The generals looked at eachother, some unsure, some stern. "A coup, sir? Are you sure?" asked one, putting down their cup of coffee. "Of course, dear Soter. We have the support of the military, who would oppose us? Her guard? It would be suicide to oppose the entire military, Cassander. "He shook his head, speaking in agreement. "Suicide, those who matter are in support."\nDorotheos  continued, looking to his third general, "Lysimachus, any objections?" The General shrugged, saying. "One, what of those . . .  disloyal Generals? You say those who matter, but Nicator isn't on board, and most love the Baroness . . . " Dorotheos gave a light chuckle, grinning warmly.

Around it, soldiers at guard waiting for any who would approach. Finding themselves at attention as a one of the Generals, Lysimachus approached via flight worried and looking flustered, he lands and rushes in, the door slamming shut.\nLysimachus quickened himself to the other Generals, who all turned to him, "Yes, I'm late . . . " He sat, and Dorotheos looked up from the map, not at all impressed but serious in expression. "Well, Lysimachus, let me get you up to speed . . . " In the middle of the table sat a map, containing the most up to date details of the Capital city; Sparleto.\n"The plan is simple . . .  with my leverage as the Marshal of the Army, Nicator and Arok will be stationed at the border, under the bogus claim that Revolutionaries from will try to jump it." Next spoke Soter, "I plan to keep my troops out of sight, if all goes south we'll move in for back up." Dorotheos looks to Cassander, who responds, pointing at key locations on the map. "Logistics, I will relieve the police chief of his . . .  burden and supplant my troops as the police force, if all goes well, the city should be under our control. Lysimachus?"\nThe Griffon cleared his throat, "Indeed, I'll have my troops stationed at all checkpoints around the City; No Griffon goes in and out until Dorotheos  is . . .  inaugurated." And with that, Dorotheos  nods his head, grinning. "Any Objections?" The generals sat silently, no objections were made."

But despite all that, still, his chest was tight with anxiety. This was the first time he'd lead forces, he'd never fought in a formal war, just drills and bandits, this would be the first time . . . \nBut today would not be that day.\nToday he would handle this with tact. He would show all of Arantiga that if he was going to do this, it would be not with a drop of blood spilled. He needed to show his people that they came first, and that striking any of them down, even for a Coup d'état! Was out of the question. It would send a Message, of who Dorotheos is, and how much his people meant to him.\nHe had been escorted by an entourage of his personal Guards to the palace, coming face to face with the palace's guard and his Sister, Margareth Featherin the baroness. He needed to handle this. He and his griffons made their way as close as they could before the palace guards demanded they halt.\nDorotheos knew what he had to do. His guards parted and out he came, Megaphone in claw. Unarmed (Mostly, he always kept a revolver as his side, as do all Generals) as to convey that he was no threat, he looked to The Guard . . .  and pleaded his case.\n"Look . . . " He began, the megaphone barely up to his beak, he was very well within shooting distance of the Guard. "I don't want violence, all of this . . .  It was to reduce the probability of violence! I refuse to spill Arantaigan blood, Don't you all agree?". He looked up and around to the armed guards. "Isn't that what you fight for? Or is it perhaps a who? The Baroness?" He scoffs, rolling his eyes.\n"My dear sister, clawless, bending the knee to Wingbardy, what kind of fight is that? Is it even a fight? Is this what you're going to die over? Perpetuating this worthless excuse for a regime? I am offering- no, GIVING you all the chance to lay down your arms, and simply . . .  Go home. Go home to your families, be it your mothers or fathers . . . " He lowers his voice.

A few well-surviving relics of the past that he had ordered to not be removed when refurbishing the old palace, laid about the room waiting to be given the attention they deserved. Much like the depraved city itself until he finally stepped in. He turned to muse at a mosaic that depicted Grover receiving a blessing from Boreas himself. It lacked more than few stones but it still was quite magnificent.\nFor a brief moment he wondered about Grover's thoughts, when he sat here in this palace, as he was planning his seemingly impossible conquests. Would he have been able to do so without the power of the Idol? Cracking sounds of an opening door returned him to reality. A group of his soldiers were half-leading, and half-dragging a brown-white, very loudly cursing griffoness. As they approached near, she was tossed before the throne.\n\n"We told you to do this in... a civilized manner." Arantigos told the commander of the soldiers. \n\n"Lord Arantigos, she told us she had better business to do than answer some questions. She called you the ‘warlord with an ego the size of the Griffonstone tree’, and resisted arrest."\n"I was wrong. His ego is the size of the goddamned Lake Rumare!" snapped the griffoness. She had a good view to witness a rather kitschy painting depicting Arantigos I handing a sword to Dorotheos. "This place was trashy beyond imagination, but now it looks like an Aquileian circus!" \n"We must admit, she has guts," said Arantigos. "But you are not here to advise me on interior decoration. The Idol of Boreas. We were being told you, and some Equestrian ponies, were the last ones to try and reclaim it. Where is it?"\n"The Idol? It fell deeper into the Abysmal Abyss which happens to be a death trap in case you forgot. Besides, it was just a useless piece of gold... at least so I heard. Going down there is suicide, and the idol is unreclaimable. No one can get down there safely with those wind gusts, as fast as a train, going through. We were only lucky to have made it out at all."\n"You will show us that place…" Arantigos smiled faintly, "and then we will see if it really is ‘unreclaimable’ as you say."\n"Only a madgriff would try to go down there!

Not long after that, elections took place and soon it was obvious that he vote was mainly divided between two of the candidates:\n\n Antioco Moro, who has recently returned to the country after being forced to leave when Dorotheos Featherin nationalised wingbardian owned industry.

arantiga.050.d:0 "With recent victories the Empire now controls a large part of Griffonia. Even after forming a kingdom Arantigans were a minority in our country - and now we are outnumbered many times by conquered nations. We cannot to rule over all those griffons using only our loyal citizens and we need to delegate power to locals - if we wish for our new regime to survive.\n Probably the safest choice would be use Wingbardians and other southerners and make them dominant group in new Arantigan Empire - most of them is supporting new reign and perceives Arantigos as their rightful ruler. In fact despite our attempts to restore old sparlean culture, we are still very similar to Wingbardians. Another option would be to discriminate minorities and support largest ethnic groups - Aquileians, Herzlanders and Wingbardians, letting them to assimilate smaller groups. Eventually we can establish laws protecting laws of all nationalities within our Empire, hopefully gaining their sympathy for our cause - although it will undoubtedly affect our centralisation efforts and government integrality.

arantiga.051.d:0 "For centuries Sparleto was the seat of the Featherin dynasty. The ancient city has a long and proud history… However as the empire grows, so does its government needs. Sparleto is simply too small and can’t hold all the necessary institutions and offices - not to say that its rather… provincial character does not suits the imperial reign. To better govern the Empire, it would be reasonable to move our capital into a bigger, more strategically located city. The best candidate is Karthin - former Wingbardian capital that would be surely easier to govern, as Arantigos would not have to face hostility of population. Some however suggest that Griffinheim, city of Grovers would best fit the splendeur of the Featherins and thanks to its more central location would make governing new realm easier. But maybe, instead of moving we should just make Sparleto worthy of Emperor and start ambitious program that will expand city into proper metropolis. Costs would be substantial and we will have to demolish many historical districts… The location makes Sparleto unreachable for enemies and like Griffinheim makes logistical issues much easier."

For centuries they paid little interest towards outside world, and not even Grovers cared enough for them to conquer these desolate lands. Now however, ponies found themselves in conflict with skynavian communists who invaded their homeland. When arantigan legions marched north we conquered Skynavia and so we did with ponies. Now however it is time to deal with them - as their lands are sparsely populated we can simply integrate them into Empire.

When locals were questioned truth was revealed - apparently mad graff took his most loyal supporters, most of their treasures and escaped - he is probably now en route to one of pirate safe havens.

After his death, those knights established themselves as defenders of the East and in some cases created even their own states like Hellquil and Longsword. When in western Griffonia age of chivalry ended long ago with beginning of industrial era, in less developed lands of the east these traditions remained alive and in some cases were twisted beyond any imagination. Now Hellsword and Evi Valley are part of Griffonian Empire and mighty knights were defeated. However, Arantiga have for a long time lacked proper knight units - perhaps it is good moment to establish such, using knights of the east. Old orders can be reinstated and made faithful servants of divine emperor… Eventually we can simply disband them and concentrate on establishing proper army instead."

Although with collapse of Griffonian Empire its privileges became a dead letter, thanks to substantial influence company held, they managed to keep strong position in southern seas. Not as influential as powerful bank of Flowena or oligarchs or Skyfall, Arantiga paid little interest to Trade Company. Now however, when we are in control of Gryphus it is time to tie up loose ends. Company even now kept operating and we could let them be, as long as they pay their taxes - however of course they will not get back their monopoly.

However just killing rebels was not actual goal of these operations – key element was to capture as many prominent republican leaders as possible – including Kemerskai himself. President-Marshal was executed few day after his capture on Cloudbury main square… however many of his lackeys were not that lucky. In lengthy interrogations, often with use of tortures, information about republican cells were gathered – and in following months executioners were rather busy across Empire, while work camps once again were filled with new batch of prisoners.

Although Skynavian forces managed to open a narrow land corridor from the city to the nearest port, the Red Army was ultimately unable to lift the siege after it began. The blockade became one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history, and possibly the costliest in casualties suffered. After each assault the Legions would constantly be repelled leading to huge casualties on the attacking side while the Skynavian troops held the city with zeal never witnessed before, Emperor Arantigos realizing that the cost of taking the city through constant assaults would be taking far too long than what he would like orders all attacks on the city to cease and afterwards ordering the assembling of all of the artillery cannons available to the siege force to bombard the city without end. By the time the bombardement was over the entire city had been leveled and not a single survivor remained, as legionnaires advance to secure the hellish landscape that remained with the wind travelling through the the ruins of the once great city creating an almost dreary atmosphere. Some historians would later on classify it as one of the bloodiest sieges ever undertaken by the soldiers of Arantiga.

But even as we proved so called “Republican Dream” to be just chickish fantasy, there are still many influential groups in Empire that even Arantigos must be concerned with and locals are often concerned with actions of central government. Ruling with iron claw seems easy for now, but when memories of victories will fade, dissent will once again mount and we may face yet another revolution. We can of course crush every sign of resistance and stick with absolute power of Divine Emperor - however it may be easier to let on formation of some form of representation - imperial parliament. We will make it splendorous and let members to perform various representative duty or argue about meaningless problems… Then people will be more busy with observing them than turning against government.

However even within Three Temples there are quite lot of regional varieties and keeping orthodoxy intact was hard challenge for generations of archons. There are also worshippers of minor deities like Eviliana or Wise Lady, Old Believers or even stranger cults, like eastern ponies who worship their own gods and spirits… And it is only part of religious mess that Griffonia is. When Arantigan Empire was established, alongside it we spread cult of Arantigos-Boreas and cult of Second Arantigos. As we took control over Archonates Three Temples were reformed to follow new version of faith, what of course created substantial resistance among traditionalists and led to several schisms but most of Griffons seems to have adjusted to changes and hopefully, imperial cult will be a pillar of Empire’s stability. Zealots suggest we should further spread Cult of Arantigos and make it not only state religion, but also only legal religion in Empire. However many griffons will be unwilling to abandon their gods and it will create a dangerous strife undermining stability of Dorotheos reign. Perhaps issuing and edict of tolerance, that will let followers of non-hostile towards our regime (and of course those that are not mad murderers like Maarties!) follow their faith in peace."

As influx of them became somewhat smaller recent times our administration had finally time to properly check who is actually still alive and what crimes are they guilty.

We purged Empire of most of troublemakers, at least for now, but we are not closed nation - creatures and goods travel, and worst of all - so do ideas. We can of course do what we can with education and propaganda to ensure that griffons remain firm supporters of Divine Emperor - however ideologies such as harmony, communism and republicanism are still being spread by foreigners and their medias. We are facing a problem of smuggling of revolutionary literature like Equestrian “Friendship Journal” or Caramel Marks works about communism. Since now we had no codified policy in this regard and although many of these books are already forbidden be printed, sold or owned in Empire, we are starting to face organised attempts to sow dissent by emigree groups and governments hostile to Empire. Therefore it is necessary to create proper Ministry of Information, that will properly censor foreign works and decide what can be published in Empire. Of course it will not eliminate problem totally but we will gain some degree of control.

Officially it was royal hunting reserve, restricted only to Dorotheos… But he never visited it… Until now. When he, and Margareth were both children they used to play in this forest, pretending to be heroes of old stories… These were good memories… and good place for eternal rest. Among old necropolis surrounding temple there was one new gravestone – without a name, just with symbol of house Featherin. After seeing old temple Dorotheos understood why his sister wanted to be buried here. It was… peaceful.\nOld griffon sat on one of crumbling monuments and for few minutes listened to singing birds. He never visited Margareth’s grave before… But now, when many decades have passed and fire that once burned in his soul started to fade… It seemed right time.\nHe recalled old memories of his childhood, days when he was happy… Even when he wondered about greatness he wanted to achieve future seemed bright. Now, as he long ago stopped be “young conqueror” he felt… empty. Millions feared him, but even more worshipped him. In every town there were monuments of Second Arantigos, in every temple griffons prayed looking on his portraits. There was no greater conqueror and probably there never will be. Griffonia was in peace, and memories of war and atrocities started to fade. But when Dorotheos closed his eyes he could see burning cities, hear screams of dying griffons. Entire generation of Arantigans died to fulfill his ambition… His old comrades were dead – replaced by sycophants and modern technocrats. It was his legacy, his Empire that his descendants will inherit. Empire built foundation of blood and death.\nNever again Arantigos has spoken to him and as years passed Dorotheos started to have second thoughts… He feared death when he would face gods – will he be welcomed among them, or treated as an usurper?He gave one last look to gravestone and recalled sister’s last words “Will it be worth it?” And after all these years..."

It is not time to celebrate tough, as eastern ponies are stubborn bunch of creatures and despite being beaten they are not going to easily surrender.

Now however, when Equestrians influence waned, we could easily conquer Mareland and eliminate potential threat it created. It is time to decide fate of ponies. Simplest choice would be just to annex Mareland - there is plenty of local griffons who are more than happy to get rid of pony dominance and will help us to govern this area. However it will most probably cause massive emigration of ponies into our other domains and spread of their “Harmony” ideology. To keep them more under control we could create state ruled by local griffons and let them deal with this issue.

Guards searched his laboratory, the cafeteria, the park, his favorite bar, and his room with no success. They even searched trains and planes leaving the area and there was no sign of him. It appears that we have lost him forever. As for his experiments, no one dares to touch or even restart them, and care will be provided for his mangled test subjects. His theory will die with him, it seems."

arantiga_decision.31.d:0 "A former Gamia University professor, Heinrich Allenstein, was one of many who submitted a proposal to the Imperial Research Initiative requesting funding for research projects. However, unlike many, he was not a fraud or a scammer, and he was not a naive scientist with impossible ideas. Instead, he was an experienced professor with a project that had a strong theoretical foundation and a firm plan of action already outlined, which of course pleased our adminstrators.\n\nHis was one of the few that was sent directly to Arantigos himself, and now, he has the greenlight and the funding to begin. Almost immediately after the approval came through, a laboratory was hastily prepared and outfitted with the necessary equipment, all of which was ready in a few days. Allenstein himself was immediately flown in from Yale, and the work can finally start."

arantiga_decision.32.d:0 "After a few days of working under the IRI, Allenstein's performace is nothing short of exemplary. He has settled into his new laboratory without issue and our liason says he gets along with his assistants well, likely a habit picked up from Gamia. However, he has contacted Arantigos for an entirely different reason.\n\nIt was known that Allenstein's experiments were considered unethical so his request is not unexpected, especially given the nature of his project. However, it is only now that he has asked for griffon test subjects for his experiments. If the IRI were to get approval, there would be no trouble procuring them and the number he asks for is a rather small amount. Regardless, the final decision lies with Arantigos."

arantiga_decision.33.t:0 "Test Subjects Required!"
arantiga_decision.33.d:0 "We have again heard from the IRI liason, and he does not bring good news. It appears that Allenstein has severely underestimated the amount of test subjects he needs, to say the least. He has requested the IRI to provide a vast amount of such test subjects, a vast increase over what he had previously said. According to the liason, Allenstein has admitted his error, but it will be substantially more difficult to procure these test subjects because of the large amount Allesntein needs.\n\nThe IRI has already begun provisions to aquire these griffons, but the question is should we? There are rumors that his research has run into snags at his laboratory and for all we know it the whole research project might end up in failure."

arantiga_decision.34.t:0 "New Equipment Required!"
arantiga_decision.34.d:0 "It appears that Allenstein has suffered a major accident in his laboratory. Allenstein, his assistants, and his test subjects are unscathed, but a lot of his equipment was damaged beyond the point of repair. A lot of money has already been lost, and Allenstein says that he not only needs the destroyed equipment replaced, he also needs items that can only be imported at great cost from Equestria, such as prosthetics and high-quality magical crystals and serum. Not only is this his most expensive request to date, after that accident doubts have surfaced within the IRI of the project's viability."

arantiga_decision.35.t:0 "The Fruits of Labor"
arantiga_decision.35.d:0 "Allenstein's hands ached after hours at the operating table. It hadn't helped that he had sent his assistants out after the accident, he had no wish to endanger them more than what was needed. Nowadays they would simply bring Allenstein what he needed and got out. Sometimes he had regretted doing so, as it meant more work for him, especially during these operations.\n\nAfter he was finished installing every last serum pump, magical receptor, and node, he sewed up the subject and inspected his work. Allenstein was soaked up to his neck in blood, and his eyes and nose burnt from all the repulsive and poisonous chemicals needed in this operation. After taking a sip of water, his eyes began to rest on the subject. The brown griffon once known as Adalbert was no longer recognizable, his body a ravaged mess of feathers and ugly technology. Allenstein's eyes teared up at the though that Adalbert was gone; he was too young to die. Alas, there was nothing he could do. After thirty minutes of not breathing or moving, he surely was dead.\n\nAs was protocol, Allenstein reached to take the griffon's pulse, when Adalbert's claw suddenly grasped his outstrechted arm. His grip was so tight that Allenstein could only grimace in intense pain as his arm was broken. He barely heard Adalbert over his own screams. "Doc. Am I alright...?" Adelbert tried to speak before he collapsed from sheer effort . His grip on Allenstein loosened and he dropped to the floor with a thud, his blood pooling around him.\n\nLuckily, his assistants came in a few minutes later and hauled Allenstein to the infirmary. When he had recovered from the shock, he made sure Adalbert was okay before setting out towards the liason's office.\n\nHe managed to catch the liason, an agreeable griffon by the name of Holt, hurriedly leaving his apartment.\n\n"Allenstein," he cried. "You alright? What happened? I was going to come over to the hospital as soon as I heard but you're already here. What the hell?" the liason recoiled at the sight of Allenstein and his broken arm.\n\n"It works! My theory is correct! The operation was a success!" Allenstein explained.\n\n"It worked? That's great news! I assume you, uh, had an accident with the subject?" Allenstein nodded. "Well, the IRI is not going to like to hear about this, so we should get a demonstration prepped as soon as possible. How soon can you hold one?""

arantiga_decision.36.d:0 "Although MagiTek prosthetics were introduced several years ago in Equestria, the ones that worked were expensive and were not much better than their organic 'counterparts'. Getting used to them required often months of training. And when the Arantigan armies marched, countless soldiers, talented, loyal soldiers, were injured, many becoming crippled. These cripples in their droves volunteered for Allenstein’s experiments. They died at the hand of Allenstien's experiments. If there was a lack of volunteers, there was more than enough convicts, which either way would end up executed.\n\nBut finally, after months of work, the project was finished and Allenstein could present results. Arantigos was invited to watch maneuvers where groups of augmented veterans would fight his elite personal guard, the Companions. Each of Allenstein’s patients lacked at least one or more limb, and their crystal eyes glowed with baleful light, and alchemic implants pumped a mixture of stimulants when they charged the Companions. Arantigos and a small group of high-ranking officers were quite surprised when the Companions were quickly defeated, as the augmented soldiers easily crushed any resistance. Finally, Arantigos called for Allenstein with a gesture of his claw.\n\n"I must admit doctor, it is quite impressive. But the costs of single augmentation..." He grinned. "I have been told that you can build several tanks with that money."\n\n"Yes indeed. And I am afraid that solving this problem may take years if not decades to solve. So many different combination of crystal magic, enchantments and alchemy..."\n\n"I read your reports; you do not need to explain the technicalities. Due to costs and limited amount of rare materials that are needed I guess we will never be able to field more than a few regiments of such soldiers. But a small, elite group of griffons will always have its uses. And I think my personal guard could also be replaced. Continue your research, doctor...""

Going by the name of Ascarius, he was apparently a prominent noble in Wittenland before being expelled. Why he was expelled, he won't say. Anyways, given the strange, fiercly meritocratic nature of Wittenland's aristocracy, and an impressive magical display, we are certain that he is competent magician. His theory has also been reviewed by Aquileian magicians, and they are confident that it will indeed work as intended.\n\nAs our realm expands, communication and transportation channels will become stretched, and Ascarius provides a simple solution to our troubles: teleportation. Of course, griffons will never be able to do more than simple enchantment, and only the most skillful of unicorns ever attempt teleportation. Instead, Ascarius proposes that a machine powered by magical crystals and bond by arcane science can transport griffons across great distances instantaneously.\n\nUnfortunately, us griffons will never have any idea what he is talking about..."

The IRI liason there recently told us that Ascarius has settled in well. His assistants like him, and work has been proceeding fast.

arantiga_decision.42.d:0 "The IRI liason has recently contacted us, with news that the project has run into financial trouble, and that Ascarius cannot proceed with his experiments without new equipment and artifacts to experiment on. Our administration was understandably confused by the liason, after all, the IRI had been provided with substantial backup funds in case an issue like this came up. So of course the liason was immediately questioned about these emergency funds, and the answer we got was nothing short of ridiculous that laughter broke out amongst our administration. But, it seems that liason was being dead serious and our funds have indeed been wasted by an over-enthusiastic Ascarius...\n\nWeeks into Project Silver Key, it appears that Ascarius decided to host a party for his assistants to 'celebrate all they had done, and to take a well-earned rest'. While unusual, our liason did not pay the matter much attention, until he held another such party the next month. From every month, it became every fortnight until they were held almost everyday, and the amount of people attending was surely not getting smaller.\n\nIt appears that the funds provided for the project fell under Ascarius' own stipend, and that he has been able to siphon this money away for his parties. He is still an capable researcher, and his reports show excellent progress, but it is clear that he will need even more money to continue..."

arantiga_decision.43.d:0 "Today, it seems that [WIT.GetLeaderName] has discovered that Ascarius has been employed by [ARA.GetName] under the IRI, and has sent back his criminal record. Given his status as nobility and his erudition, it seems suprising that he has one, but when our administration got hands on it, it became all to clear...\n\nLast night, the IRI liason phoned in to tell us that Ascarius has been arrested on charges of possessing illegal substances and vandalism. It appears that his party last night, which was his biggest, spiralled out of control as creatures became intoxicated on the wildest variety of narcotics you could ever find. This is enough to warrant an arrest, but it appears that the revelers decided to go on the rampage and damage sections of town. As the host of the offending party, Ascarius was thrown in prison, and he faces trial tomorrow, where it is all but certain that he will be judged guilty. \n\nOn one hand, we could allow the trial to go ahead without interference, and he will be thrown in jail. What may turn into a embarresment to the government would have been disposed of, but his expertise and knowledge make him invaluable to Project Silver Key, which is why is the lead researcher. It can not continue without him. Meanwhile we could spare him from his fate and bring him back to his research, although the liason is concerned that he will not end his habit of partying, which could become a problem in the future.\n\nAs a compromise, a young assistant of Ascarius has proposed the we let the trial go ahead, and after his sentence is decided, blackmail him to speed up progress on his project. If he does not listen, and the project is not complete by the deadline, he will be back in jail. This may be a bit extralegal, but given the nature of our country, it should not be too hard to accomplish. In the end, they choice is yours..."

Perhaps he found our deadline threatening, or maybe he just didn't find jail the best place to be, but our method was effective, and with the first reports rolling in, it seems that the project will meet the deadline after all.

Now, magic is one of the largest fields of science of which we have absolutely zero knowledge about anything. Even the unicorns have no idea why the spells they are using work. As for the great magical philosphers, they have long since past.\n\n"But, I have reason to believe that they had had cracked the enigma, which would allow them to bend magic, and indeed, the world, to their will. Their work ought to be lost to history, but a few fragments remain, and I believe that these fragements are the key to making this teleporter work.\n\n"Our work has come to a halt, and it is only with these fragments that remain will I be able to power the machine with crystals, instead of being powered by magicians. I have heard that crystals are being synthezied in Equestria for a purpose like this, but my expertise lies in magic, not maths. Please, we are so close to a breakthrough..." Ascarius trailed off. Nothing but silence from his end of the call. It seems that this request is so important to the unicorn that he decided to call the IRI Chief in person, rather than through the liason. In any case, it's up to you to decide."

arantiga_decision.46.t:0 "Day of Reckoning"
arantiga_decision.46.d:0 "Ascarius was nervous - time was passing quickly, and the deadline was rapidly approaching. And he knew that project overseers were growing restless and starting to complain about the mounting costs of exotic materials, rare magical equipment and arcane tomes imported from Equestria. In no time, information about his lack of progress would reach Arantigos, and then... well, he knew the rumors of how short-tempered the Emperor was. But he knows he is close - and soon the secrets of Star Swirl’s magic will finally be revealed. When years ago he found copy of one of his great tractates about magic, he knew he could achieve truly great things, even if on the back of Star Swirls' own acheivements.\n\nAnd now, when he was so closed, he would not be stopped by those greedy griffons. And so they worked, day and night, trying to finish their project and prepare a working prototype. Now it is ready - first they need to make few tests of short-range teleportation. The air was buzzing with energy, as crystal pylons were loaded into the machine. When all was ready, Ascarius pulled the lever... But stones they wanted to teleport did not dissapeared.\n\n"What is going on?" the annoyed unicorn asked one of his assistants.\n\n"I have no idea. Everything seems fine, energy readings are growing..."\n\nAscarius pushed him away from the screens and tried to understand what was happening. A few moments later he started shaking from fear."Turn it off! TURN IT OFF! We are not teleporting these away, we are summoning something HERE! It will overload whole system!"\n\nBut before anyone could react, the device suddenly stopped buzzing, and then it exploded. Waves of light scorched everything it touched - machines, ponies and griffons, turning them all into dust. In a few seconds, everyone inside the facility was dead. When soldiers from the outside returned to investigate, they found only a single living being - a griffon in military uniform, who clearly was never part of the facility."

We discovered that this survivor was none other than Reiner Greenfeather, a high ranking officer of Reichsarmee... serving Emperor Grover V. When we crossed out the possibility of insanity, an analysis of the details of his story clearly indicate that he had come from another... timeline? dimension? Our scientists are still arguing about the name, but clearly, the world Greenfeather came from is much different from ours. In his world, the Empire did not collapse, and instead was engaged in brutal fighting with the River Empire. During one of the battles, Reiner's command post was attacked by an experimental unicorn spell, that instead of killing him, somehow linked with the Silver Key device and transported him here.\n\nAlthough his stories of things like the Equestrian king, Sombra, alicorn demons ravaging Equus and other more bizarre events will provide excellent material for novels, they are not very useful for us - and apparently the technology of his dimension was similar to ours. Project Silver Key will be shut down owing to the death of entire staff, including Ascarius himself - without him we are not able to rebuild the device. Aquileian magicians were later brought in, and, after analyzing what remained, were suprised that we have not caused a much greater magical disaster.\n\nAs for Reiner...

### Leader Descriptions ###
generic_neutral_leader_desc:0 "Baroness Margareth Featherin has been ruling Arantiga for the past decade with a just and fair claw, but even she cannot deny that under her reign, there has been a decisive lack of progress as Wingbardian capitalists seized most of the Arantigan industry. However, she believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, and that Arantiga's current woes can be resolved with a few careful words, something her more notable brother and general in the army, Dorotheos, disagrees with."
literally_alexander_desc:0 "The younger brother of the former Baroness, Dorotheos Featherin has been yearning to learn about the Arantigan military as long as he could remember. He spent many hours in the national library perusing the tales of old Arantigos, how he had defeated armies more numerous than his, only to be felled by the plague after his latest conquest. Since then, Dorotheos has made it his life goal to join the Arantigan officer corps, with his brilliant mind astounding even the most senior leadership. His quick rise to success can be attributed solely to his capabilities, and once he was in position to reform the armed forces, he did so with great fervour, restoring some of their old glory. But this was not enough for Dorotheos, as he wished above all to restore the ancient Kingdom. The die was cast, and the coup was a success - he shall restore Arantiga's glory."
generic_harmony_birb_desc:0 "One of the many Wingbardian investors who made their fortune in Arantiga, Antioco Moro has made Arantiga his home. Smitten by the local culture and history, he has invested much of his profits into rebuilding Arantiga, and unlike his fellow capitalists, his workers had a fair paycheck and numerous benefits. The dreadful coup has almost destroyed his lifework, and he was one of the first to gather his political party for the elections, campaigning on the promises of a better, peaceful Arantiga. The populace have not forgotten his contribution to the society, and he now leads Arantiga to a brighter tomorrow."
another_nazbol_guy_desc:0 "Ciriaco Mediate leads the new Arantiga. He was content as a common soldier in the Arantigan army, proud of his state, but much changed after he read a particularly thought provoking manifesto. The Rozenkamp brothers' unique blend of socialism and nationalism great inspired him, and he began spreading his views within his battalion. Although some suspect he was covertly supporting Dorotheos in his failed coup, he dismissed all those claims, saying that the state must achieve balance between the patriots and the proletariat. Ciriaco's extreme ideology has found fertile ground in every aspect of Arantiga's society, even as some questioned its viability."
alexander_but_woke_desc:0 "Dorotheos Featherin has heard Boreas' instructions and he has taken them well. Having proclaimed himself the reborn Arantigos, he is set to fulfill his destiny and reestablish the ancient Kingdom. This he swears."

Arantigans have no forgotten their legacy, and we were, and still are, famed for our martial traditions. There are plenty of mercenary companies composed of Arantigans, their descendants or groups of griffons who have not forgotten their heritage and who are willing to return to their ancestral homeland to reclaim its former glory..."
ARA_last_legion:0 "Hire the Karthin Legion"
ARA_last_legion_desc:0 "The so called 'Karthin Legion' claims to be the descended from the armies of the fallen Kingdom of Karthin, conquered by Wingbardians ages ago. There is little truth to this claim, but there is no doubt that the legion has existed for centuries and they are considered as one of the most battle-hardened companies in the whole of Griffonia."
ARA_true_legion:0 "Hire the Romau Legion"
ARA_true_legion_desc:0 "Romau was the northenmost city of the Arantigan Empire, founded as a border stronghold by Arantigos himself. Before it became the seat of the Eyrite Archonate, many citizens worshipped Arantigos-Boreas. Small groups of such believers still exist to this day, banding with the remnants of the Romau Legionnaires to form the 'Romau Legion' when Grover II sacked the city."
ARA_francistrian_volunteers:0 "Recruit Francistrian Volunteers"
ARA_francistrian_volunteers_desc:0 "In the days of Arantigan twilight, many of our people live in what is today Francistrian territory. With the rebirth of the Arantigan dream of greatness, many of these griffons will join our fight. They just need a little encouragement..."
ARA_call_diaspora:0 "Recall the Diaspora"
ARA_call_diaspora_desc:0 "Many native Arantigans live abroad in cities like Karthin, Griffenheim, and Manehattan. By organizing propaganda campaigns, perhaps we can encourage some of them to return and help us regain our former greatness..."

ARA_renaming_cities:0 "Renaming Cities"
ARA_renaming_cities_desc:0 "Our great empire is dotted with massive cities. Some cities have made us look the fool, and others are simply hard for our adminstrators to write down or speak out loud. A name change is in order."
ARA_rename_karthin:0 "Down with Karthin!"
ARA_rename_karthin_desc:0 "Now, with the former capital of Wingbardy in our claws, maybe it is time to show our superiority and rename the city to make it a reminder for those who would ever dare to oppose our divine king..."

ARA_definetely_not_fake_IRI:0 "The Imperial Research Initiative"
ARA_definetely_not_fake_IRI_desc:0 "The IRI, or the Imperial Research Initiative, is a umbrella programme that allows us to invest funds into promising research projects that many consider unethical or dangerous without inviting... unwanted attention. While many of the so-called 'scientists' are nothing but frauds, some former Yalish students have promising ideas and are asking for financial support.\n\n§YNote: These projects will be incredibly costly...§!\n\n§RThere is always a risk of something going horribly wrong...§!"
ARA_hammer_of_god:0 "Project Gotterhammer"
ARA_hammer_of_god_desc:0 "Magical crystals are known as a source of incredible power. With their use, magicians are able to change reality and they are a crucial component of most magitek equipment. Bright Glow, a nuclear scientist from Aquileia has presented plans of an experimental 'crystal bomb' that may provide us with the ultimate weapon of mass destruction."
ARA_miracle_cure:0 "Project Panaceum"
ARA_miracle_cure_desc:0 "A group of researchers from Greenback University has requested our support for their research into a so-called 'universal cure'. They intend to use 'Magiforgs', modified microorganisms, to heal even the most deadly diseases and, as for now, tests results are highly promising."
ARA_super_soldiers:0 "Project Legionary"
ARA_super_soldiers_desc:0 "Although Gamia University was almost completely devastated during conflicts in Herzland, one of its researchers, Heinrich Allenstein, is offering us his services in improving the physical capabilities of our soldiers - if we provide him with enough... test subjects. However we should be careful; he was expelled for experiments even his colleagues considered... unethical."
ARA_teleportation_device:0 "Project Silver Key"
ARA_teleportation_device_desc:0 "Despite being talented in many ways, griffons lack the magical abilities of unicorns, who are able to cast a wide variety of spells. Luckily, we might be able to solve this problem in part - a powerful Wittenlander mage, Ascarius, who, after losing favours at court, arrived in griffon lands after working for many years on various MagiTek projects - and now has offered us his services, hoping we could finance a teleportation device he is designing."

### Cosmetic ###
tungsten_desc:0 "Literally just a piece of tungsten. It was promoted in 1005 by Dorotheos as a way to poke fun at Nicator and as such, it has its own desk, uniform, salary, and right to be present in the general staff meetings."
soter_desc:0 "Soter Litori, the owl of Arantiga, was born in 980 in the forests south of Ponteles. One of the brightest mind of the Arantigan general staff, his upbringing in the boondocks gave him the skills to traverse the thick forests of Arantiga with ease, and teach others how to do it. This, along with his charisma and great loyalty to the state of Arantiga made him (at the time of his promotion at 26 years old) the youngest General in the Arantigan Army."
cassander_desc:0 ""Commando Cassander" as he's often called, is the Griffon in charge of the Divisione di Forze Speciali, also called "that place where money goes in and invisible griffons come out" by Dorotheos"
lysimachus_desc:0 "Lysimachus is the newest addition to the Arantigan General Staff. A fanatic admirer of Dorotheos, he probably knows more about the Field Marshal than his own mother ever did. Able to inspire soldiers to almost the same level of zealotry as him, he is in charge of recruiting the new generation of Arantigans into the army"
nicator_desc:0 "Nicator Whitebeak is second in both command and ego of the Arantigan army, after Dorotheos himself. Promoted by Duchess Margareth, Nicator is famous for his strategy of shelling the enemy to Tartarus, and being damn good at doing it too."
