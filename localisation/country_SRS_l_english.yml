#### LEADERS ####
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"

Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

SRS_yeet_communalists_desc:0 "Communalist thought was our foremost obstacle preventing us from ending the "War in the North" before it took tens of thousands of lives on both sides. With the most radical communalists out in the streets, we have a "casus belli" to put an end to their opposition."

SRS_approach_the_tribes_desc:0 "The Congress has decided to peacefully approach the tribes. It is known that they are traditionally a peace-loving federation of tribes that fight furiously once their peace had been disturbed, which explains the furiousity we faced during our march further north back in 986. A harmonic union will be most beneficial to both peoples, and is possible."

SRS_meet_with_waifu_desc:0 "After our pony diplomats somehow managed to break the language barrier and negotiated for a cease-fire, it is time for Sickleclaw to personally shake claw and hoof with the leader, Princess Fiana II. It will be a very... interesting encounter to say the least."

SRS_speak_herzlander:0 "The Speak Herzlander Program"
SRS_speak_herzlander_desc:0 "The "Speak Herzlander" program is to make Herzlander an universal language understood at an rudimentary level by every citizen, without alienating the native tongues of non-herzlander citizens.

SRS_monarchists_be_gone_desc:0 "The un-educated masses of Vedina don't care who is the tax collector, 'tis the harsh truth.

SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have.

SRS_consolidated_gunmakers_union_desc:0 "There are dozens of independent minor gunmakers in both urban and rural communities.

SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"

SRS_the_northern_star_desc:0 "Our people live in heaven-on-griffonia already, but we can do better. By establishing a market-socialist economy, and positive relations with the harmonic, albeit capitalist nations of the world, it will allow socialists from those countries to easily immigrate to Skynavia.

SRS_libtard_economics:0 "A Market Economy"
SRS_libtard_economics_desc:0 "As we're rejoining the Republican cause, we should strive to improve our economy via the free market. We can't go around making Skynavia a capitalist paradise overnight, though, so a market socialist economy will do just fine."

Retreating from a conquerable Imperial force, while knowing well the Imperial scum will raze yours and your comrades' livelihoods to the ground both is and will be portrayed as the most vile act a creature can commit.

SRS_victory_desc:0 "The triband is flying over Griffenheim once again, and we should all be grateful for Sickleclaw and his actions: unifying the north almost single-clawedly and rejoined the cause. This decisive thinking resulted in our current standing in the world, and Sickleclaw has an obvious advantage in the upcoming elections following the liberation of Griffenheim."
SRS_herzland_conquered:0 "The Liberation of Herzland"
SRS_herzland_conquered_desc:0 "It is time to engage in the reconsctruction of Griffonian society as a whole. The Empire has tried to rise from the ashes... tried... but met it's fate by our righteous fury. The miniscule amount of griffons still doubting in Sickleclaw now have no reason to, for he is the one who brought us here."
SRS_revenge:0 "Revenge"
SRS_revenge_desc:0 "All the Imperial war criminals, both from this war and the counter-revolution that promted the march north, are to be tried and executed. Not in public, though, for Sickleclaw deems this act barbaric."
SRS_herzland_nobility_punishment:0 "The End of the Nobility"
SRS_herzland_nobility_punishment_desc:0 "The appendix of griffon society is finally about to be brought to the end it richly deserved. Just like in Vedina, the scum will be tried. If they come out as benevolent nobles like Gerlach of Feathisia, they get stripped of their titles and get freed, we'll let Boreas sort out the vile part of the nobility..."
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment:0 "The Reformation of the Clergy"
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment_desc:0 "We can't just get rid of the clergy without inciting an uprising. Therefore, we will reform it. Eros, Erion and Proteus will be replaced by more... loyal religious citizens."

SRS_bestboi_desc:0 "Young minds are easily molded, and blue-blooded youth are no exception..."
SRS_postwar_prosperity:0 "Post-War Prosperity"

SRS_serf_emancipation:0 "The Proclamation of Serf Emancipation"
SRS_serf_emancipation_desc:0 "The serfs of old now own the land they toiled on for generations, and not the vile noble who demanded rent on top of the regular Imperial tax. The countryside will grow to be more acceptable to our rule over time."
SRS_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
SRS_land_redistribution_desc:0 "The land previously owned by private entrepeneurs of noble and... disloyal citizens of monetarily privileged birth will be collectivized. No exceptions, if one puts up resistance, torch it all on fire."
SRS_revoke_the_privilegia:0 "No More Privileges"
SRS_revoke_the_privilegia_desc:0 "Privileges of nobles and Imperial industrialists are officialy revoked. As always: no exceptions. They can always try their shot at earning those privileges through honest labour any time they want."
SRS_gulag_industrialists:0 "Punish the Industrialists"
SRS_gulag_industrialists_desc:0 "As much as it hurts to say this, the former industrialists will be treated in the same way the former nobility is. The worst get the noose as the decent try to reform themselves in a brave new world under our watchful eyes."
SRS_protecc_the_worker:0 "Protect the Worker"
SRS_protecc_the_worker_desc:0 "The average worker up north in New Skynavia has a more comfortable work enviroment than the average Herzlander worker. The aforementioned Herzlander worker will get to know work, with zero risk of losing wings to machinery."
SRS_unite_griffonkind:0 "Unite Griffonkind"
SRS_unite_griffonkind_desc:0 "Our job isn't done yet. We cannot sit in Griffenheim while half of Griffonkind is under oppressive regimes. Sickleclaw will lead us through the hardships of war once again, for a brighter future, where everygriff is free to pursue their dream."
SRS_core_south_herzland:0 "Southern Herzland Draft Exemption Revocation"
SRS_core_south_herzland_desc:0 "We will need every creature we can get to accomplish the objective of uniting Griffonia. Alongside the rural areas surrounding Griffenheim, populations from Romau, Greifenmarschen, Yale, Katerin and Angriver will not be exempt from conscription anymore."
SRS_core_north_herzland:0 "Northern Herzland Draft Exemption Revocation"
SRS_core_north_herzland_desc:0 "We will need every creature we can get to accomplish the objective of uniting Griffonia. Populations from Feathisia, Erdbeereland, and Bronzehill are not exempt from conscription anymore."
SRS_warplan_purple_white:0 "Warplan Purple-White"
SRS_warplan_purple_white_desc:0 "Warplan "Purple-White" is the plan concerning the annexation of Wingbardy, Falcor and other southern illegitimate states. If leaked, the namesake might anger the Falcorian natonalist population, but as if we're going to let them walk after they expose themselves..."
SRS_warplan_purple_gold:0 "Warplan Purple-Gold"
SRS_warplan_purple_gold_desc:0 "Warplan "Purple-Gold" is the plan concerning the annexation of non-republican and non-socialist nations of western and central griffonia. It's namesake being the Aquileian royal flag."
SRS_warplan_rice:0 "Warplan Rice"
SRS_warplan_rice_desc:0 "Warplan "Rice" is the plan concerning the annexation of dissident states in the Evi valley. Nogriff really had any name for this warplan, so the generalstaff just code-named it "Rice" and called it a day." 
SRS_all_is_well:0 "All is Well"
SRS_all_is_well_desc:0 ""If you want something done right, do it yourself!" - That was essentially Sickleclaw's life motto. Now that he had done what would be botched under the General Congress, maybe it's time to enjoy the fruits of his labour, like a true worker should."
SRS_state_of_the_army:0 "The State of the Army"
SRS_state_of_the_army_desc:0 "After the civil war, many former anti-sickleclaw militants were given amnesty. Some joined the army in efforts to destroy it from within. Fortunately there are no democratic processes concering kicking disloyal members out for treason ever since the founding of Sickleclaw's militias themselves back in the '80s"
SRS_officer_purge_1:0 "Captains and Lieutenants..."
SRS_officer_purge_1_desc:0 "One of the most regrettable things for Sickleclaw, is that even some platoon and company commanders are pro-congress, but haven't rebelled against Sickleclaw for unknown reasons. Now that they have new friends in the rank and file, we must audit them all."
SRS_officer_purge_2:0 "...Ensigns and Sergeants"
SRS_officer_purge_2_desc:0 "The problem we noticed after auditing and promptly purging disloyal commissioned officers, we found out that... the problem is huge. Now, non-commissioned officers are to be audited as well."

SRS_rankfile_purge_2:0 "...And a Slight Adjustment"
SRS_rankfile_purge_2_desc:0 "...Should also actually introduce recruitment standards while we're at it."
SRS_new_chain_of_command:0 "Reform the Chain of Command"
SRS_new_chain_of_command_desc:0 "What Sickleclaw was taught in a military academy is not compatible for today's battlefields. Highly-portable artillery pieces, one-creature operated automatic weaponry and many other innovations are more useful when left with a degree of autonomy in the field of battle."
SRS_gas_gas_gas:0 "Gas! Gas! Gas!"
SRS_gas_gas_gas_desc:0 "The enemy might use some rather nasty things against us, using the old "communists aren't people!" excuse... If it comes to that, Sickleclaw would personally destroy hundreds of respiratory systems at one push of a button."
SRS_new_talent:0 "New Talent"
SRS_new_talent_desc:0 "There are quite a lot of "armchair generals" within our borders. Maybe, if we hear some out, we could get some insight on what to do to improve our armed forces. We could also snatch an extra general or two, since the generalstaff hasn't gotten some "fresh blood" in years."
SRS_mobile_warfare:0 "Cult of Motorization"
SRS_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Motor vehicles, like trucks, are widely adaptable to military use, and don't require heavy and expensive armour plating like tanks. This could be expolited in order to create what is essentially an army on wheels."
SRS_sickleclaws_tankies:0 "Birth of Skynavian Armour"
SRS_sickleclaws_tankies_desc:0 "It is well known that Skynavia attracted many experts from all fields of science persecuted for their beliefs in socialism, and our land is rich in resources. If we put our back into it, we can make a Skynavian armoured vehicle industry a real thing."
SRS_sickleclaws_shinier_tankies:0 "Sickleclaw's Insight"
SRS_sickleclaws_shinier_tankies_desc:0 "Sickleclaw is fascinated by tanks. So much so, that he is in the position to give advice for new designs. Just keep him away from the people who advocated for one-creature turrets, for the love of Boreas..."
SRS_outmanouver_them:0 "Outmanouver Them!"
SRS_outmanouver_them_desc:0 "The future of warfare is on tracks, and covered by a sloped 90 milimiter plate of steel. Enough said."
SRS_better_cannons:0 "Better Cannons"
SRS_better_cannons_desc:0 "The cannons we have at our disposal are not satisfactory. Those pieces aren't even breech-loaded! Let's acquire a few Stalliongradian cannons and build cannons similar to that design."
SRS_reliable_weaponry:0 "Reliable Weaponry"

SRS_outgun_them:0 "Outgun Them!"
SRS_outgun_them_desc:0 "There is no such thing as "too much firepower", moderate bombardment is just ammunition conservation."
SRS_mass_assault:0 "Tried and Tested"
SRS_mass_assault_desc:0 "We aren't in a position to rely on a professional army, we must throw as many personnel into the front to prevent the untimely destruction of our nation."
SRS_tankbusters:0 "Tank-Busters"
SRS_tankbusters_desc:0 "The Severyanan revolution proved that even some tractors with armour plating are able to punch a hole through a line, given the soldiers aren't properly equipped for destroying these machines. Resources shall be diverted in order to help development of such weapons."
SRS_medicine:0 "Medicine"
SRS_medicine_desc:0 "Charging into combat knowing that even flesh wounds are fatal is not so great for morale. Every soldier shall know how to administer basic first aid, to keep the wounded soldier alive until they reach an aid station."
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier:0 "Drecreased Recruitment Standards"
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier_desc:0 "We can't be too picky with our recruits, for the strategic-oriented mindset of the high command requires strength in numbers. Our army might lose some prestige, but we really can't manage any other way."
SRS_winter_training:0 "Winter Training"
SRS_winter_training_desc:0 "The Skynavian winter - Only a widow's heart is colder. Luckily, we have a million creatures who are used to it. Their knowledge will be used to help the comrades who live further down south to bear with the cold much better."
SRS_relentless_assault:0 "Relentless Assault"
SRS_relentless_assault_desc:0 ""The Imperial might question us : "Why are we still attacking after losing thousands?". To that we shall respond: "You retreat after losing a thousand troops? are you that weak?""
SRS_experimental_warfare:0 "Experimental Warfare"
SRS_experimental_warfare_desc:0 "We must improvise - our recruitment pool is too miniscule for a grand strategic-oriented doctrine, and our war machine is too small for mass prodction of vehicles. Instead, we will have our own... amalgamation of a doctrine. We sincerely hope it works."
SRS_magic_guns:0 "Magic Guns"
SRS_magic_guns_desc:0 "A bored militagriff somewhere in the Littlegriff mountain range shoved a magic crystal up the barrel in their rifle, loaded a round, and pulled the trigger. Surprisingly, it didn't blow up, instead it fired a magical ray that, upon further investion, can pierce fifteen to twenty milimeters of steel plate. When the bored soul was asked how does it work, he merely answered "Hey, it's magic! I ain't gotta explain shit!""
SRS_expand_specops:0 "Expand Spec-Ops Units"
SRS_expand_specops_desc:0 "Skynavia is full of hardy folks, we can easily bolster our special operations formations from those aforementioned hardy folks."
SRS_rocket_artillery:0 "Rocket Artillery"
SRS_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "A regular artillery piece fires one shell. For the same production cost, an multiple-rocket launch system can fire oh-dozens of projectiles. If this isn't cost-effectiveness, then I don't know what it is."
SRS_use_radio:0 "Utilization of the Radio"
SRS_use_radio_desc:0 "Wireless communications are the future, and military use of wireless field telephones will bolster interest in further research. Soon enough, Skynavia would become five years in front of Griffenheim for all we know."
SRS_superheavy_tanks_xdxdxd:0 "Project Acturius"
SRS_superheavy_tanks_xdxdxd_desc:0 "We are not allowed to confirm nor deny the existence of "Project Acturius"."
SRS_harness_crystal_energy:0 "Harness the Crystal"
SRS_harness_crystal_energy_desc:0 "It is common knowledge that some magic crystals can be used to... forgive my Aquileian, blow shit up. There could be a possibility of a bomb with an undescribable yield, able to wipe out entire cities in one go. Why not be the first one to field a weapon that can destroy the world?"
SRS_rocketry:0 "Rocketry"
SRS_rocketry_desc:0 "Imagine hitting a target anywhere on the face of Griffonia, from Skynavia to, let's say... Kivessin. Horrifying, right? That's why even peace-loving people want this, to prevent war by hypothetical gunpoint. Upon the unveiling of such a weapon, we might have peace in our time..."
SRS_radar_experiments:0 "Radar Experiments"
SRS_radar_experiments_desc:0 "NOTHING EVADES THE VISION OF THE ALL-SEEING EYE!"

SRS_deal_with_the_undead_threat_desc:0 "The Northern Territories have come under our protection. The greatest threat posed to our collective safety can be found not in the machinations of capitalist imperialism, but in the nebulous, sinister dealings of the mysterious Dread League to the east.\n\nWe must take measures to protect against this rising threat from the distant past, or we will all be turned into undead."

SRS_welcome_socialist_clergy:0 "Welcome Socialist Clergy"
SRS_welcome_socialist_clergy_desc:0 "There are those griffons of faith who have adopted socialism as a means of rooting out injustice in the world and delivering salvation to the masses. In fact, the only thing many of them care about more than the emancipation of their flock from the capitalist yoke is the defence of all creatures from the unholy abomination that is the Dread League.\n\nWe should welcome these radical clergygriffs into our country to take part in our shared revolutionary struggle, as well as the fight to contain the undead threat."
SRS_the_hail_forest_dmz:0 "The Hail Forest Autonomous Region"
SRS_the_hail_forest_dmz_desc:0 "Deep in the ancient woods of the Hail Forest lie dozens of small, fiercely independent communes, each bent on achieving their own idealised version of utopian socialism.\n\nThey work with no one but the most ardent Communalists, and allow no troops to enter their forest.\n\nThe §Ydemilitarised§! status of the §YAutonomous Region§! must come to an end sooner or later, as its undefended border poses a security threat."
