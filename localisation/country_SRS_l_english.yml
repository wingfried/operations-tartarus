####EPIC SICKLECLAW SUBMOD GAMING LOC :flushed:####
#### FOCI ####
SRS_finishing_touches:0 "Final Reforms"
SRS_finishing_touches_desc:0 "Despite his initial support for the idea of a General Congress, Sickleclaw has begun spreading a more radical idea. His followers - mostly the personnel of the frontier militia and many internationalist thinkers - are clamouring for the delayment of the Congress until the liberation of Griffenheim under Sickleclaw's leadership - when the revolution is safe from reaction."
SRS_sickleclaw_betrays_congress:0 "The Power-grab"
SRS_sickleclaw_betrays_congress_desc:0 "Sickleclaw seems to have become emboldened by support for him. Only one spark is needed for the powderkeg to explode, and that spark will be Sickleclaw announcing his takeover."
SRS_sickleclaw_obeys_congress:0 "Transition of Power"
SRS_sickleclaw_obeys_congress_desc:0 "Despite a sizeable support base for a permanent Sickleclaw government, comrade Asper has no intentions of refusing to step down. All power to the Congress!"
SRS_civwar_battle_1:0 "The Battle for Ostfloy"
SRS_civwar_battle_1_desc:0 "The first campaign of the war - the Ostfloy Campaign - resulted in negligible casualties on both sides and Sickleclaw's assertion of control over Ostfloy."
SRS_civwar_battle_2:0 "Combat in the Delta"
SRS_civwar_battle_2_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's army isn't the only force fighting for the "toppling" of the congress. Many skirmishes between pro-Sickleclaw and pro-Congress militias occured during the civil war in and around the city, albeit those more resembled the situation in Fezera than an actual war."
SRS_civwar_battle_3:0 "Up the Little Griff"
SRS_civwar_battle_3_desc:0 "Mountain warfare is quite a grueling ordeal. While Sickleclaw's regular formations are duking it out with the mostly untrained pro-Congress forces, the bulk of Sickleclaw's elite will be delegated to rooting out resistance in the Little Griff mountain range."
SRS_civwar_battle_4:0 "The City is Ours!"
SRS_civwar_battle_4_desc:0 "The pro-Sickleclaw forces are now to head into the city. It will be painful for Asper to see the city in such a state of disrepair due to the urban skirmishes, but it is neccessary for Skynavia to survive as a socialist nation."
SRS_civwar_battle_5:0 "Into the Forest"
SRS_civwar_battle_5_desc:0 "The last stronghold of the pro-Congress forces is Bluffhead. It will be a treacherous path to the settlement, with primitivists and guerillas haunting these woods."
SRS_civwar_end:0 "Successful Pacification"
SRS_civwar_end_desc:0 "It had to be done. Sickleclaw took over, and will undoubtedly honour his promises of establishing the congress when the revolution has been truly secured. He will now make an effort to earn back the trust of the people by guaranteeing all rights the Skynavian citizen holds dear."
SRS_national_security:0 "A Matter of National Security"
SRS_national_security_desc:0 "The commotion here and its result had surely attracted attention to us. We should be wary of a potential infiltration from Cloudbury. An invasion from the north in this time of strife is Kemerskai's worst nightmare, and he ought to do anything to prevent such scenario."
SRS_communist_asper:0 "The Fight Rages On"
SRS_communist_asper_desc:0 "Let it be known: comrade Sickleclaw will never betray the workers and peasants of Griffonia! Skynavia stands alone in the sea of monarchism, fascism and ruthless capitalism it found itself in, and will make an effort to drain that sea!"
SRS_conscript_army:0 "Bolster the Ranks"
SRS_conscript_army_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's ideas require a strong military to break free from the reactionary powers that surround our young socialist state. As long as it gives more numbers, it goes. The only option off the table is total conscription, at least for now."
SRS_rev_mil_soviet:0 "Ratify the Sickleclaw Constitution"
SRS_rev_mil_soviet_desc:0 "The Sickleclaw Constitution of 1007 strips Sickleclaw of powers most dictators would defend with their very lives. Two legislative bodies are to be established: the Revolutionary Military Council, and the Civilian Representative Congress, both limited to modifying their respective aspects of Skynavian society."
SRS_defend_the_revolution:0 "For the Defense of the Revolution"
SRS_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "We cannot let the evil capitalists crush our revolution, not in battle, nor in the "Unsichtbaren Front". As much as it hurts the core libertarian values of the Skyanvian citizen, an intelligence service must be established, for our own good."
SRS_avenge_986:0 "Avenge 986"
SRS_avenge_986_desc:0 "The 986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic, giving Kemerskai an underclawed victory against Sickleclaw, was the catalyst for the second march north. Where are they now? The Cloudburian citizen is at the risk of famine, in poverty, and his tax idols are usurped by corrupt politicians. The Republican authority in Cloudbury has been delcared an illegitimate state, and war is inevitable."
SRS_ntrwar_commie:0 "The Delayed Pacification"
SRS_ntrwar_commie_desc:0 "First step towards breaking the siege is pacifying the tribes who are currently hostile towards us. With them out of the picture, we can srike our southern neighbours while their guard is down."
SRS_far_north_republic:0 "The Far Northern Republic"
SRS_far_north_republic_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we are to face furious resistance in the event of annexation of tribal territory. Therefore, we shall establish the Far Northern Republic, a native rule government, in total obedience to us. At the moment, no consctruction projects will take place within the territory of the FNR, to respect the anti-modernity sentiment of the local populace."
SRS_commie_yeetvedina:0 "The End of an Era"
SRS_commie_yeetvedina_desc:0 "Feudalism is one of the greatest evils our revolution has to face. Despite harmonic ideals, the Vedinian system hasn't changed for the entire existence of the Kingdom. Therefore, we are to free the people, and try the former masters for the crimes against the feudal bondsgriffs."
SRS_north_united:0 "The Crimson North"
SRS_north_united_desc:0 "What Kemerskai, nor the decentralized commune of old hadn't been able to accomplish has been, well, just made a reality by comrade Sickleclaw. Uniting the north is just the beginning, though..."
SRS_conscription_reform:0 "Recruitment Policy Reform"
SRS_conscription_reform_desc:0 "With the siege broken, we can affort sending a large chunk of our military griffonpower and ponypower back home. These losses should also be replaced with fresh and enthusiastic recruits from Vedina and Cloudbury."
SRS_economic_reform:0 "Socialist Economic Reform"
SRS_economic_reform_desc:0 "We must make an effort to help the ailing people of Vedina and Cloudbury to recover from their barbaric economic policies that favour the privileged classes. Only then we shall expect to compete with the somehow-recovering Empire."
SRS_education_reform:0 "Socialist Education Reform"
SRS_education_reform_desc:0 "We can accelerate the removal of the anti-communist dogma by educating the illiterate people of Vedina and Cloudbury with a curriculum specifically tailored for indocrination. "
SRS_kemerskai_fate:0 "Kemerskai's Fate"
SRS_kemerskai_fate_desc:0 "Traitors always reap what they sow, and Kemerskai is not an exception. The Revolutionary Miliatry Council shall debate on what to do with that rat."
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak:0 "Pacify the Mountains"
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak_desc:0 "In the mountainous north, there is not a richer mountain range than Brantbeak. By taking it, we would deny capitalists resources, and secure our eastern flank from potential Imperial onslaught."
SRS_on_to_griffenheim:0 "On to Griffenheim!"
SRS_on_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "With our power in the north consolidated, we can withstand a strike from the Kaiser, and perhaps even take the fight to him."
SRS_great_patriotic_war:0 "The Great Revolutionary War"
SRS_great_patriotic_war_desc:0 "We are confident, with our growing popular support and military strengh, that we shall bring an end to the decadent Empire, and liberate its working class citizens from the seemingly eternal oppressive bondage of the Grover dynasty and their lackeys."
SRS_road_of_pragmatism:0 "Road of Pragmatism"
SRS_road_of_pragmatism_desc:0 "Idealism has gained nothing for Skynavia for many years. The revolutionary zeal has to give way to a more reasoned approach at some point or the cycle of internal conflict is sure to continue in perpetuity. Exporting the revolution also needs to be reexamined since Skynavia has scarcely survived the past twenty years."
SRS_heal_the_scars:0 "Heal The Scars"
SRS_heal_the_scars_desc:0 "Like an illness, political healing needs a prescription that the patient will willingly take and accept that the therapy will be hard work."
SRS_new_life_initiative:0 "New Life Initiative"
SRS_new_life_initiative_desc:0 "A proposed solution is ready to be published as a booklet for the masses to read. It should buy the party enough time to stabilise the country for a while. The concept of market socialism will help win back our dissenting youth whilst reassuring the traditionalists that free enterprise will not run amok."
SRS_fortress_skynavia:0 "Fortress Skynavia"
SRS_fortress_skynavia_desc:0 "Skynavia has a tiny population relative to its greatest threats, but the industrialization of warfare provides great favour to the defender. Concrete bunkers and emplacements will not only deter an invader, but allow the people’s army to inflict great damage upon those who would interrupt our recovery efforts. The first phase of this strategy is to cover the capital from all approaches as recent history has shown how easily the city can be contested and thus jeopardise campaigns away from home."
SRS_border_fortification:0 "Border Fortification"
SRS_border_fortification_desc:0 "Now that the city can be easily held with just the local militias if need be, concerns about holding the border must be addressed. For now, a thin string of bunkers will reassure the rural population that we won’t abandon them and show our enemies that we are no longer a broken nation."
SRS_lil_griff_anti_monarchist_rampart:0 "Little Griff Anti-Monarchist Rampart"
SRS_lil_griff_anti_monarchist_rampart_desc:0 "The current military consensus is that Vedina may see our recent weaknesses as a fine adventure for their foolish young Princess to embark upon. With their strengthened defence line, the people shall say “You shall not pass!”"
SRS_bro_anti_capitalist_rampart:0 "Braunles Anti-Capitalist Rampart"
SRS_bro_anti_capitalist_rampart_desc:0 "Our old rival has suffered just as much instability as we have and Kemerskai’s squabbling warlords may exploit it to their own advantage. However, their armies are forever battling bandits, each other and tribesponies, so a strengthened defence line is sure to deter them from looking outwards."
SRS_dinkau_wall:0 "Dinkau Wall"
SRS_dinkau_wall_desc:0 "All of these bunkers on land will be compromised if the enemy bypasses them with an amphibious landing. Therefore the coasts shall be guarded with permanent artillery emplacements and pillboxes."
SRS_stalliongrad_cooperation:0 "Stalliongrad Cooperation"
SRS_stalliongrad_cooperation_desc:0 "Skynavia now commands a coalition of socialism in the north. Perhaps Stalliongrad will finally take notice of us, because even if our systems differ, our enemies do not. A trading deal and general cooperation would be immensely beneficial to both sides even if a full alliance is not possible."
SRS_workers_tour_of_duty:0 "Worker’s Tour of Duty"
SRS_workers_tour_of_duty_desc:0 "Griffonpower is a precious thing and we can risk only so many volunteer units in Stalliongrad’s war. The solution to committing more griffons to Stalliongrad’s cause with a lower risk is to send groups of engineers and workers to run the factories. Those who volunteer will be rewarded with a Worker’s Tour of Duty medal to show their commitment to helping their socialist brothers and sisters unite against a common threat. If we activate this program, Stalliongrad industrialists will offer us some of their designs and documentation for modern factories."
SRS_pan_socialist_tech_exchange:0 "Pan-Socialist Technology Exchange"
SRS_pan_socialist_tech_exchange_desc:0 "In recognition of our contributions to Stalliongrad’s cause, a joint research committee is to be formed so that our nations can exchange and collaborate on mutually beneficial projects."
SRS_collective_mining_effort:0 "Collective Mining Effort"
SRS_collective_mining_effort_desc:0 ""
SRS_turhamn_pact:0 "Turhamn Pact"
SRS_turhamn_pact_desc:0 "The satellite states are forming new armies that will be seconded to the Skynavian Supreme Command to form a unified defence of socialism. This pact of mutual economic cooperation and defence will be signed in Turhamn to underline the fact that Skynavia implicitly trusts its socialist partners."
SRS_unlikely_membership:0 "Unlikely Membership"
SRS_unlikely_membership_desc:0 "Whilst Skynavia is a growing regional power, we cannot take on the Empire on our own. It is time to set aside our differences and ally with the Republic against a far greater enemy... for now."
SRS_revise_the_sickleclaw_doctrine:0 "Revise the Sickleclaw Doctrine"
SRS_revise_the_sickleclaw_doctrine_desc:0 "Our position is far better than it was just a few years ago. We have reliable and prosperous satellite states fueling the Turnham Pact’s economy to the point that our previously unreachable prize is in reach again: Cloudbury. We must seize the opportunity to liberate it before Kemerskai and his warlords finish consolidating his republic into a real war machine."
SRS_settle_the_score:0 "Settle the Score"
SRS_settle_the_score_desc:0 "We have prevailed with the help of an old enemy against the ultimate threat. It is now time to permanently end the animosity by the pen or sword."
SRS_detente:0 "Detente"
SRS_detente_desc:0 "The war to defeat the Empire has been long and costly. It is also majority occupied by other forces who are unwilling to grant us territory. As such, it is time to formally warm up relations with the Republic so that a lasting peace can be reached that will benefit everyone."
SRS_oil_trading:0 "Oil Trading"
SRS_oil_trading_desc:0 "The demand for oil is higher than ever before as nations build up great industrial bases. Our former enemy is thirsty for this stuff and we are thirsty for income to improve our society. See where this is going?"
SRS_reopen_border:0 "Reopen the Border"
SRS_reopen_border_desc:0 "Both the Turhamn Pact and Griffonian Republic have resources the other is hungry for. We have plenty of raw materials to mine and they have far superior agricultural production. Customs agencies are to be expanded so that goods may flow back and forth without delay."
SRS_trade_deal:0 "Trade Deal"
SRS_trade_deal_desc:0 "There are a variety of agreements in place to facilitate trading with Cloudbury to the point it is becoming complicated. Delegates should be sent out at once to create a single trade deal to cover everything in a more centralised manner."
SRS_northern_rail_network:0 "New Northern Rail Link"
SRS_northern_rail_network_desc:0 "Since the border has opened up, the volume of traffic is becoming too much to handle for both side’s rail and highway network. A joint investment is the answer to this and another sign of peace between our two nations."
SRS_lil_griff_treaty:0 "Little Griff Treaty"
SRS_lil_griff_treaty_desc:0 "All of this progress towards peace will be meaningless if mutual recognition of borders and states are not codified into a solid treaty. Let’s resolve the issue once and for all so that the next decade will not see the continent torn asunder by another series of bloody and destructive wars."
SRS_skynavia_versus_the_forces_of_evil:0 "Skynavia vs. The Forces of Evil"
SRS_skynavia_versus_the_forces_of_evil_desc:0 ""
SRS_operation_eclipse:0 "Operation Eclipse"
SRS_operation_eclipse_desc:0 "Cloudbury is ours! The dream is alive bar the blemish that is the Sunstriker Clan. Operation Eclipse is the answer to a problem that Kemerskai failed to resolve."
SRS_cloudbury_anti_imperialism_rampart:0 "Cloudbury Anti-Imperialism Rampart"
SRS_cloudbury_anti_imperialism_rampart_desc:0 "The Turnhamn Pact has reached the very limits of how far we can expand. It is time to expand on the existing fortifications that will be renamed appropriately. From these bunkers, the Empire will bleed itself white trying to crush the socialist dream."
SRS_sunstriker_anti_imperialism_rampart:0 "Brantbeak Redout"
SRS_sunstriker_anti_imperialism_rampart_desc:0 "Brantbeak is already a readily defensible position thanks to its rugged mountains, but it will become even more rugged when the enemy is ambushed by hidden bunkers at every chokepoint."
SRS_air_and_radar:0 "Air Defence"
SRS_air_and_radar_desc:0 "Fortifications are not enough to turn back an invader. Control of the skies will be crucial in further negating the numerical advantage of the Imperial Army. To do this efficiently, a string of airfields with brand new radar systems will let our planes accurately predict where the intruders will be."
SRS_integrate_brantbeak:0 "Integrate Brantbeak"
SRS_integrate_brantbeak_desc:0 "Bandits and an insurgency are hindering efforts to reconstruct Brantbeak’s embracing of socialism. These counterrevolutionaries must be routed so the workers may be free of their terrorist tactics."
SRS_cloudbury_under_socialism:0 "Cloudbury Under Socialism"
SRS_cloudbury_under_socialism_desc:0 "Whereas Brantbeak has an insurgency problem, Cloudbury is more welcoming of our ideology but is instead weighed down by an issue of bilingualism and strong ethnic identity. Care must be taken to prevent pride blinding everyone to reason."
SRS_billingualism_act:0 "Bilingualism Act"
SRS_billingualism_act_desc:0 "Now that the regional government is functional, congress can pass and effectively enact a bill to ensure that Cloudburian speaking griffons will be treated equally. It will go a long way to winning over those who are restless and feeling marginalised."
SRS_consolidate_our_position:0 "Consolidate our Position"
SRS_consolidate_our_position_desc:0 "Skynavia has grown into a larger nation than we ever imagined! Having our seat of government so far away from our most populous region is not practical, therefore we will be transferring the capital to Cloudbury, the beating heart of northern socialism."
SRS_form_the_union_of_griffonian_socialist_states:0 "Form the UGSS"
SRS_form_the_union_of_griffonian_socialist_states_desc:0 "The name ‘Skynavia’ is no longer a terribly inclusive one given the size of our territory. It is time to fully embrace our new identity and reforms by proclaiming the Union of Griffonian Socialist States! Glory to the triumphant revolution!"
SRS_prywhen_cooperation:0 "Prywhen Cooperation"
SRS_prywhen_cooperation_desc:0 "Skynavia now commands a coalition of socialism in the north, so now Prywhen will be receptive to our influence and assistance as they too seek to build a socialist bloc of their own."
SRS_socialism_abroad:0 "Socialism Abroad"
SRS_socialism_abroad_desc:0 "The extent of Skynavia’s direct control of Griffonia has been reached for the foreseeable future, but there is a great deal to be done for the socialist cause abroad as our time with Prywhen has shown. Many countries will welcome foreign intervention in their conflicts even if our ideologies clash, so we shall send them our champions of socialism to show them the way forward."
SRS_prywhen_joint_army_training:0 "Art of War"
SRS_prywhen_joint_army_training_desc:0 "The rough and hardy griffons of Prywhen are experts of living off the land and operating in miserable conditions. Some unlucky officers will be selected to go and romp around Prywhen to experience this for themselves so they can pass it on to their troops who will surely adore them for this. We’ll even teach Prywhen a few things about our own ways of warfare too."
SRS_propaganda_machine_goes_brrrt:0 "Power of The Printed Word"
SRS_propaganda_machine_goes_brrrt_desc:0 "Comrade Redglad has done a lot to unify and strengthen his cause through the written word as we have already seen in his most recent book. His propaganda minister also knows how to keep griffons who are living in near-famine conditions to keep marching and resist the urge to be selfish. We could use some of that inspiration as well given the challenges we face. In exchange, we will pay Prywhen with canned food in recognition of their heroic struggle in famine conditions at times."
SRS_the_sickleclaw_doctrine:0 "The Sickleclaw Doctrine"
SRS_the_sickleclaw_doctrine_desc:0 "Dreams of exporting the revolution to Cloudbury and beyond are not a realistic prospect after Skynavia itself almost collapsed in on itself. The answer to the long-term survival of northern socialism is to liberate the oppressed peoples of countries that can be swiftly invaded and become useful satellite states. "
SRS_operation_toppler:0 "Operation Toppler"
SRS_operation_toppler_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Vedina is ripe for revolution. Its peasants have no rights, no future and the nobility hoard their wealth. A sudden strike could topple the monarchy and not only grant us grateful new workers, but farmland, industry and a buffer against Republicanism. Controlling so much territory will be too costly and difficult to govern, so once victory is attained, a new socialist state will be run by worthy Vedinan socialists in our stead."
SRS_vedinian_economic_plan:0 "Vedinian Economic Plan"
SRS_vedinian_economic_plan_desc:0 "The Socailist Republic of Vedina has been liberated in the midst of economic development that must be redirected for the benefit of the people. A team of economists and engineers will be sent to direct it along market socialist lines."
SRS_vedinian_bounty:0 "Vedinian Bounty"
SRS_vedinian_bounty_desc:0 "Now that the economy is functioning correctly, resources can now be tapped and exploited to the mutual benefit of all northern socialists."
SRS_operation_evergreen:0 "Operation Evergreen"
SRS_operation_evergreen_desc:0 "Like the Kingdom of Vedina, the tribes are at a crossroads where their commoners would be very open to socialism if it spells the end of their oppressive nobility. It would also end the perpetual border conflict and give us socialist brothers and sisters who will face the real enemy together. Outright conquest will result in a continuation of the perpetual insurgency of previous decades, so tribesponies with the right kind of mindset will rule in our stead until their society becomes more industrialized."
SRS_tame_the_wilderness:0 "Tame the Wilderness"
SRS_tame_the_wilderness_desc:0 "The tribal regions have rarely known permanent roads, let alone the railway. Let us fix that and join with our little ponies of the north. Alongside this light infrastructure, a small industrial base will help introduce them to socialism on a scale they can comprehend."
SRS_tribal_auxiliaries:0 "Tribal Auxiliaries"
SRS_tribal_auxiliaries_desc:0 "It is not the right time to fully industrialise the tribes, but the constant border conflicts of previous years has shown that they have a warrior ethos that can be harnessed as their contribution to socialism."
SRS_knak_lil_anti_capitalist_rampart:0 "Knäktberg-Little Griff Anti-Capitalist Rampart"
SRS_knak_lil_anti_capitalist_rampart_desc:0 "Vedina shares a border with our old enemy. It would be far easier to hold if the riverbank was studded with bunkers and emplacements that will fill our socialist brothers with confidence knowing that we won’t abandon them in times of war."
SRS_operation_collective:0 "Operation Collective"
SRS_operation_collective_desc:0 "These islands of scum and villainy are ripe for the taking and many other countries agree. If we could liberate them from fascist claws, Skynavia’s influence on the shipping lanes would be greatly beneficial to us. As an added bonus there are claims of oil reserves that will be worth investigating."
SRS_the_people_flying_circus:0 "The People’s Flying Circus"
SRS_the_people_flying_circus_desc:0 "Shameless arms dealers provided Meyer with his airborne pirate fleet. The sheer variety of designs we’re going to receive will be beneficial to our design bureaus, while it will be a pain to train our pilots to not shoot at these new designs in our inventory."
SRS_fortress_haukland:0 "Fortress Haukland"
SRS_fortress_haukland_desc:0 "Like the rest of our socialist states, the Hauklands will be threatened by Imperialist interests who would stand to gain a great deal from seizing the islands. Coastal artillery is the answer to holding off an invader until help arrives, or better yet, deter an invasion altogether."
SRS_operation_colonist:0 "Operation Colonist"
SRS_operation_colonist_desc:0 "Who said that the northern expansion had to be limited to one continent? Imagine being able to project Skynavian socialism’s influence to Equus. Our brothers and sisters there would be eternally grateful to be lifted from the poverty created by unrestricted capitalism."
SRS_nova_griffonia_development_initiative:0 "Nova Griffonia Development Initiative"
SRS_nova_griffonia_development_initiative_desc:0 "The sad state of Nova Griffonia’s industry must be addressed at once, or else the downtrodden workers will never know the prosperity of market socialism. Industrialisation will be spread out in order to show to all griffons that we will not favour the urbanites over the rural regions."
SRS_nova_griffonian_shinies:0 "Nova Griffonian Shinies"
SRS_nova_griffonian_shinies_desc:0 "The economy of our newest socialist ally is recovering to the point that it can start exploiting untapped natural resources; then Nova Griffonia will truly enjoy the benefits of Skynavia’s superior economic system."
SRS_seasonal_workers:0 "Seasonal Workers"
SRS_seasonal_workers_desc:0 "Unemployment will still be an issue in our system despite our best efforts, but this can temporarily be eased by offering citizens from our fellow socialist states a chance to work for a few months in Skynavia’s understaffed factories and construction crews."
SRS_industrialization_effort:0 "Industrialization Effort"
SRS_industrialization_effort_desc:0 "Skynavia is lagging behind in industrial innovations. We shall look to cooperate with our Severyan comrades in order to compete with the Cloudburians and Imperials."

SRS_unfinished_urban_projects:0 "Unfinished Urban Projects"
SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized arms factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have. Now that the internationalists don't have a leash, it's nigh time to finish construction of these buildings for the good of the Skynavian people."

SRS_sweet_oil:0 "The Ostfloy Oil Deposit"
SRS_sweet_oil_desc:0 "As a communist country, we cannot easily acquire the resources we need from the international market.

SRS_small_scale_dinkau:0 "Aid Dinkau Development"
SRS_small_scale_dinkau_desc:0 "Contacting the previously uncontacted settlers of Dinkau is going to allow us to reap the benefits of their local fishing industry. Their contribution to the mutual aid program would be used to feed communes further inland."
SRS_small_scale_bluffhead:0 "Aid Bluffhead Development"
SRS_small_scale_bluffhead_desc:0 "Bluffhead harbours a sizeable lumber industry, and will contribute a huge part of it towards the mutual aid program. Our comrades in the city won't be freezing with cozy fires in their homes. "
SRS_one_big_union:0 "One Big Union!"

SRS_consolidated_gunmakers_union_desc:0 "There are dozens of independent minor gunmakers in both urban and rural communities. Organizing all of them under the "Consolidated Gunmakers' Union" as a sort of a military-industrial complex will help pour equipment into the fight against the reactionary forces."
SRS_mass_unionization:0 "Mass Consolidation"

SRS_inland_industry:0 "Inland Industrial Development"
SRS_inland_industry_desc:0 "Until now, only New Skynavia proper, Dinkau, and Bluffhead bore the brunt of industrial development. To keep the population of Braunles and Ostfloy away from migrating en-masse to the big cities, we shall develop those two provinces, so that they are stars of the north, shining alongside New Skynavia."
SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"

Our Aquileian comrades remember it well, and the phrase "Ils Ne Passeront Pas!", their warcry, will be universally adopted amongst every single creature serving in the armed forces, along with their hardy, sometimes suicidal tactics.

srs_sickocivwartwo.0.t:0 "The Ever-Chaotic Congress"
srs_sickocivwartwo.0.d:0 "The room was filled with meaningless shouting. Again. Sickleclaw sighed, and leaned back in his seat as he contemplated just leaving the room for a long scenic walk into the forest. Those foolish congressgriffins all refuse to work together. Not even when the country is burning down to ground around them, and not even for the betterment of griffinkind. The griffs he had to contend with would sooner praise Celestia than actually cooperate. His idealist vision of a congress governing everything was turning sour by the minute.\n\n"We have said this before, and we will say it again: our party will not compromise with those corrupt and immoral griffs who wish to break the ordinary working griff’s body and spirit with those harsh production quotas. It is against the principles of our nation to coerce the workers into harsher and harsher conditions only to prepare them to fight the ponies of the Northern Tribes." A tall, imposing griff said as she shouted across the room to assert dominance. "I hope to never see those wretched and vile ideas proposed within this chamber ever again."\n\n"Ha! And what would you have us do instead? Have ghosts staff our factories?" a short, bespectacled griffin that sat across the other side of the room laughed mirthlessly as he shot Sickleclaw a glare. "Face it! We need even more demanding quotas to reflect the urgent needs our country has in order to get a mediocre parity against our neighbours who would sooner see our revolutionary ideals snuffed out in the night and stranded without a home once again!"\n\n"Well, all I see is beaks opening and closing, quacking like ducks, the lot of you. We could be having the same discussion for another century and no resolution would be reached!" Asper finally said, breaking his silence. He scanned the faces across the room, and all he could see was reluctant agreement. "This deadlock cannot go on for any longer, or we will have created an emergency that all Skynavians will have to deal with while ineffectual politicians flap their wings and shake their beaks behind closed doors. Something must be done. My word, if it has to be me that sort out this mess then so be it."\n\n"If you can pull something together and help the working griffin retain their dignity, then we would be happy to pledge our support." The female griff said, her entire demeanour still radiated displeasure. "And I suppose this will be the cue for some griffin soaring out in disagreement?"\n\n"No, no. In fact, if Comrade Sickleclaw wants to handle everything by his lonesome and save us the trouble, then we are more than happy to oblige." The glasses-wearing griffin drawled sarcastically, his voice dripped with venom as he flapped his wings. "I suppose five months would be a reasonable timeframe to resolve our disagreements on the paths forward for our nation?"\n\n"That would be more than enough." Sickleclaw shot back, "If I hear one more peep out of any of you at the end of this, I promise you that all you will see is one very angry griffon. Are we clear on this?""

This is his responsibility, and he will fix it to the best of his ability. He owed it to his country to do this.\n\nThe latest reports had not brought much good news. He picked up the first report placed on top of the delicate pile of paper and started reading, it wasn’t long before a deep and overwhelming despair welled up inside him.\n\n‘The Republican border won’t hold for much longer,’ He muttered to himself, ‘Those bandits aren’t leaving our troops alone. If we were to leave them unimpeded, then what would that say about us? We would be weak, ineffectual in the face of a border crisis...no, we can’t let this happen.’\n\nOn the other claw, the second report in terms of urgency was in regard to the tribal ponies. They had never stopped fighting them, much to Sickleclaw’s annoyance. In spite of the People’s army being there to placate them, they still attack from the shadows, causing unnecessary death and suffering. Now, a line had truly been crossed. The tribal warbands had taken resistance to another level.\n\nHe closed his eyes. There would be enough resources for him to pursue an investigation into one of the two issues at claw.

It was like defying the natural ways of things to be high up in the sky, but there it was. Being able to soar on in the night sky made him feel liberated and freed of the chains that threaten to drag him back to the ground again.\n\nBut such a moment is not to last, for he has a purpose. They have to identify the bandit nests that lie somewhere upon the borders of Skynavia, his team has already narrowed it down to a few spots to root them out. Those covert reconnaissance missions will be able to give him an edge over them should it come down to it.\n\nFinally, he touched back down to the ground and saw his comrades hidden out in the forest, deep within the undergrowth, armed to the beak with weapons designed specifically to incapacitate as quickly as possible.\n\n‘There’s a camp about a click downwind, we go in from all sides and overwhelm them before they can mount a defence. Ready?’ He said, and then relayed his commands once again over the radio.\n\nHe watched his griffins all get into position; all possible avenues of escape had been blocked off by now. The bandits are asleep, with only two griffs to stand guard for the entire camp, this will be a piece of cake.\n\nFinally, he gave the signal to go and within moments the entire camp broke out in a flurry of noise and actions as the still-sleepy bandits, to their credit, readied themselves for combat even against overwhelming odds.\n\nSickleclaw grimaced, he underestimated their ability to react to a surprise attack, to be sure, but his forces still hold control and an overwhelming advantage, if he was to approach them now and talk them down...perhaps he could resolve this without firing a single shot. Lives would be saved if they are the cooperative type...but it is obvious that his team held a definitive firepower advantage over those ill-equipped ruffians, why risk trusting those bandits to be better griffs and give them an opportunity to catch his team off guard?\n\nIn the end, he decided to..."

I am here to negotiate an end to this conflict.' Sickleclaw said calmly, 'Put down your weapons. We don’t need to use them for a polite discussion, now, do we?' \n\n'You are a dirty traitor to our revolution. Why should we trust you?' One of the griffins scowled, 'You’ve all got your fancy guns aimed right at us. So if we put our weapons down, how do we know you won’t just shoot us?' \n\n'If I thought there was no chance of establishing a minimal sense of trust, then we would not be having this conversation right now.' Sickleclaw paused and weighed up what he was about to say. 'To me, your lives are just as important to me as the griffins that stand besides me. We are all griffins here, and in-fighting when we could stand united under one common goal sickens me."\n\n"Do you really mean that?' he saw another one of the bandit griffins relax her posture.\n\n'Of course,' Sickleclaw grinned, 'I am committed to bringing fairless to the workers. Now tell me your name.'\n\n'My name is Glinda.' She replied curtly, 'But if you think this will be enough to convince us to lay down our arms, it won’t be enough. We have committed ourselves to the true revolution.'\n\n'The request can become an order, if you like.' Sickleclaw stared her down.\n\n'And why aren’t you putting your weapons down, then?' Glinda asked, 'If you really believe in all of this hoity-toity rhetoric, then put your words where your beak is and we all put our weapons down on the ground.' \n\n'Of course. We will holster our weapons.' Sickleclaw said without hesitation, and ordered his loyal griffins to holster their weapons. 'Now, as a gesture of goodwill, will you agree to continued negotiations?'"

No matter how many times I read through the submitted documentation, I could not believe my very eyes,’ Sickleclaw sighed, ‘I needed to hear this straight from the mouth of the griffons responsible for patrolling this blasted place before I can get my head around how this developed into such a mess.’ \n\nOne of the guards stepped forward, his face masked by a jumble of nerves. He saluted shakily and did his best to report. \n\n‘Comrade Sickleclaw, we did our best to hold against the tribals, but they caught us by surprise. It came like a flash, sir. After it all ended, we examined their tracks and found partially covered hoofprints intermingled with griffon pawprints. It had led us to the only logical conclusion we could derive from this piece of information...there was insider knowledge reaching the tribals, and they are striking at us where it hurts when we are least expecting it, Comrade,’ The soldier said, he stared straight at Sickleclaw, ‘At this point, all of our efforts at the border would be made worthless if they could identify and subvert even the most hidden outposts.’ \n\nSickleclaw massaged his forehead, he felt a headache coming on. On all fronts, they were at a disadvantage, this will not do. The tribesponies had been actively resistant to their efforts to pacify them for many moons, but now it seems as though they have found collaborators to help them in their efforts. \n\nWhile two battalions of troops from the city could end this problem by outnumbering the sympathisers, but diverting these strategic reserves could leave them open to other threats.

He went through a timeline in his mind as he weighed up the value of his two decades of struggle to form the true pan-Griffonian state. The more he brooded over it, the more and more the value slipped like those volatile stock markets of the capitalist world.

Limited direct combat took place at the outskirts and infiltration teams planted demolition charges in the sewers to collapse roads, but neither side had the strength to strike harder. Supply convoys were also raided in a bid to starve out the city.\n\n“What’s our munition production looking like per week?” Sickleclaw asked a worker’s council leader,\n\n“Not great. Our tooling is older than the griffons working it and we’re getting bogged down in council meetings.”\n\n“Debating more efficient methods, I hope.”\n\n“To a degree, but it's hard to get a majority vote on new methods and how much quality control is needed.”\n\n“Hmm, maybe those young student protestors are right about having a more centralised management system.”\n\nThe council leader was agape.\n\n“But we would still have unions of course.” he hastened to add."

These fresh reserves caused great dismay and shunted Sickleclaw’s army back into a defensive position only some eight kilometers from their starting point.\n\Once again, Sickleclaw found himself back in his office alone and awaiting new reports. He looked at a map pinned to the wall and eyed up Stalliongrad and his thoughts began to stray towards what a decisive authoritarian leader could do... what he could do... but such thinking was contrary to all that Skynavia stood for!

The enemy stockpiles were low to begin with and their few factories were just as clunky. His army’s morale began to recover and the prospect of a second breakout became realistic.\n\nTime was against him, so he once again banked on a rapid advance, this time to the eastern border where its porous nature led to tribesponies capitalising on the conflict for their own objectives. Sometimes their attacks would conveniently coincide with the Congressional army’s actions, be it a diversion or a supporting attack clearly avoiding their new friends.\n\nAll the while, Sickleclaw and his officers were concerned that not only the tribes could exploit the situation. If Kemerskai or his warlord rivals got their act together, Skynavia would be rolled up in a matter of weeks, or less if the youth movement welcomed the republicans.\n\nThe proceeding month was agony as his army slowly divided the Congressional Army down into boxes that could be starved into surrendering. Several more pockets saw reason as Sickleclaw twisted the arms of the factory worker’s councils to ramp up production, thus the attrition caused by artillery intensified. Their morale frayed as the Congressional officers began experiencing breakdowns in command as they struggled to reach a consensus on how to link up their regiments again. There were no such cripplingly indecisive arguments in Sickleclaw’s more rigid command structure.\n\nThis ‘Thunder of the Gods’ was enough to cause the tribesponies to slip away across the border, despite the affinity they had gained for modern rifles. With that lifeline severed, the exhausted Congressional Army laid down its arms when Sickleclaw promised them hot soup."

From both continents, Meyer’s Luftwaffe consisted of numerous models of aircraft that he was able to purchase with ease through a few extra ‘delivery fees’ to get the disassembled planes past embargoes and any oversight.\n(Airforce officer) pored through the sparse documentation to discover that some of the instructors who arrived with the planes were active military personnel who were there with the full knowledge of their government. No wonder none had been found when the Skynavian marines made it ashore!\nDespite the distasteful methods of acquisition, these planes would be repurposed to serve the people. Yet it still disgusted him that some of the torpedo bombers bore kill markings of innocent civilian shipping and the navies of those who enforced embargoes upon Meyer’s greedy little pirate empire."

This would be nothing like the congress hall full of griffons and ponies that he could easily read and estimate. Instead, he was up against a system far more rigid and uncompromising than his own. Many of Stalliongrad’s high-ranking party members had even denounced him for being a traitor to the revolution since he embraced market socialism rather than total state control.\nRegardless, clearly some of them had changed their tune now that Skynavia commanded its own bloc with a booming economy.

Tongues were further loosened as gifts of alcohol were exchanged. Nostalgia about revolutions were shared and fallen comrades remembered.\nAfter recovering from their impromptu party, a treaty of cooperation was drafted and swiftly approved. It was filled with trade deals, promises of material aid in times of war and technology exchange programs, but most importantly for Stalliongrad, the oil they thirsted for lest they faced Equestria or the Changelings."

With this major sucess towards the completion of the Revolution and one less obstacle towards the true enemy of the workers of Griffonia - the Empire itself - preparations were made to stabilize the recently liberated territories and to implement the "Transitional Rural Economic Policy" - also known as "T.R.E.P." - as a means to help the rural populace accept gradual change from the old order to the new. Despite the small scale capitalism occuring in the rural areas though, the cities are taking the brunt of collectivization efforts, and will inevitably become shining beacons of socialism alongside New Skynavia.\n\nUnfortuantely, this decision upset one of the regional governors - namely the governor of Winghagen - who saw such a measure as a revision of the precepts of the revolution and had been making his complaints known to the central authority.\n\n"Comrade, I am sorry to be calling you at such a late hour, but these new directives are frankly outrageous! How is the Vanguard-Marshal hoping to achieve the objectives of the revolution when he himself is unwilling to fully implement the policies from back home?"\n\nThe voice of the clearly tired Governor-General of Cloudbury spoke to the griffon on the other side of the line - "Comrade, your half-dozen complaints from this week have been dully noted, but this is not a matter of debate. Comrade Sickleclaw knows best and you are to carry out your orders. If I hear one more word from you daring to question the decisions of the central authority I shall have you arrested for treason!

After all, the arch-traitor did not provide such dignity for their defeated enemy when the Republicans took over Cloudbury and indiscriminately killed off the Cloudburian royal family, so why should we?\n\nNow it is them who are going north on paw and claw. Same conditions as our fallen comrades - starvation, the cold, and a native ambushing party if they manage to nearly finish the punishment march.\n\nThe propagandists of the reaction will have a field day with their fate - portraying us as murderers and every other murder-related word in the dictionary - but we will make no excuses for the terror."

Through ruined streets walked hundreds of soldiers, carrying the red banner that could only have been the Skynavian flag.\n\nThe castle fortress violently rocked again.\n\nThis was not the feeling of cannon fire. Another look, and he could see a formation in the distance. They had what looked like a dozen massive cannons.

He had heard the stories about the Republican menace, threatening the lives of Griffons everywhere.\n\nWith what strength he had, he picked his cot up and barricaded it against the door, along with the rest of what was in his cell. With luck they would just leave him alone... the army was gonna beat them back... and he didn't want to be in more trouble when they did.\n\nHours he waited there, listening to the shouting of orders, the cracks of guns firing and the screams of falling griffons. For awhile this went on...until things fell silent. He heard some talking, doors opening.. was it the guards?\n\nThen he saw them. The soldiers with the crimson banners. They were going from cell to cell, some shooting the ones inside, but for many more...they were letting the prisoners go.\n\nThe old coot from down the hall ran past his cell, shouting about liberation and freedom.\n\nFreedom.\n\nThat word sounded good right about now... the army wasnt here anymore... all he did was steal food...\n\nHe shouted out to the soldiers in a desperate bid for attention. \n\n"Hey!

Well, the Skynavian people, at least. The Vedinians and Cloudburians will need more time to see the benefits in prolonged co-operation with us.\n\nToday, the Vanguard-Marshal decides either to finally install the General Congress as a governing body of the socialist Republic himself, or exploit the euphoria of the Skynavian people, namely by holding a referendum on this matter that would most certainly result in an outcome in favour of Sickleclaw remaining the Vanguard-Marshal for life, greatly boosting his legitimacy as a leader."

None of it had been spared from combat as the revolution forcefully exported itself southwards. But before the wealth could be redistributed to the people, the people themselves had chosen to redistribute the vintage alcohol according to each griffon’s needs.\n\nSickleclaw himself turned up before the Imperial Senate had been fully secured just to reminisce about the previous battles fought here, but this time, he was going forwards rather than backwards. He smiled at the camera crew that had broken out the precious stockpile of colour film and good audio equipment.\n\nHis very serious speech was interrupted when he saw the flag on the domed roof of the final objective get taken down. He howled and cheered and embraced the nearest griffon he could grab. The bewildered comrade grinned awkwardly and handed him a bottle of fancy looted liqeur.\n\nWith a burst of youthful speed, Sickleclaw flew up to the dome with his nervous bodyguards.

On trial today were another batch of the Imperial General Staff, the ultimate middle-griffs within the highest ranks of the Imperial hierarchy, the ones who made their orders happen. They sat at a long table in uniforms stripped of all insignia besides a prisoner number. Their expressions ranged from disdain, blank stares and hints of defeatism. All eyes, however, were on Anicetus Mudbeak. He seemed downright relieved to be on trial. He answered question after question without hesitation and each one seemed to lift a weight off his shoulders rather than weigh them down.\n\n“Mister Mudbeak, is it true that the twenty-second corps received explicit orders to commandeer a train full of food intended for a prisoner of war camp known to be dangerously under-provisioned?”\n\n“Yes, your honour.” he said as he opened a folder tagged as evidence, “I was not able to stop those orders, but I stashed away documentation meant to be destroyed when their headquarters in northern Luxwingburg was overrun.”\n\n“Is it true that some two hundred prisoners died of starvation or related illnesses caused by their weakened state?”\n\n“That is correct. No regard was given to the prisoners as the war turned in favour of Skynavian forces-”\n\n“Objection, your honour.” said a polite and stern diamond dog by the name of Haupthetzen Benito, “I interject that defendant Mudbeak is embellishing the story with the sole motivation of seeking a reduced sentence. Some provisions were still delivered and invalids were relocated to hospitals when their situation became critical.”\n\n“My sole motivation is the truth!” Mudbeak said in an uncharacteristically snappy tone, “Yours is mindless loyalty even when it means pointless war!”\n\nIt felt so good to finally say something that had been on his mind for decades\n\n“I again cast doubt on Mudbeak’s credibility. The griffon lacks honour-”\n\n“That’s enough.” the judge waved his gavel at them, “The court will hear all admissible evidence and testimony in due course.”\n\nThe rest of the defendants shrugged, sighed or slouched in their chairs.

#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be re-elected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are responsible for representing the opinions of their electorates they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by preventing the formation of a politican caste.\n\nAlthough the General Congress is sometimes inefficient due to its delegates all being amateurs at statecraft, the Congress can proudly lay claim to being one of the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and perhaps in the entire world as well."
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
PROUDPONE_NAME_DESC:0 "Pierre Ponehon was born in Prance, Equestria, but left his overbearing family at an early age to travel the world. In Griffonia, he got tangled up with the revolutionaries and while initially a mercenary, he adopted the ideals of socialism swiftly and eagerly, even publishing some writings about an own more radical form of anarchist socialism.\n\nHe'll ask Maar for help before he asks Boreas and would serve Nightmare Moon before Celestia: whoever fights the powers that be in the world he will gladly support. After the failed revolution and the flight north he departed to aid other socialist movements around the world. These have included Stalliongrad, Longsword and the Brodfeld Revolutionaries and no matter where he has gone, he has only been more convinced of the need to send the old order crashing down."
GOLDGRIFF_NAME_DESC:0 "Born in Nova Griffonia in 946 as the daughter of a dockworker, Emma Goldgriff was introduced to the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion at an early age and spent some time in Stalliongrad during her younger years. During the revolution of 978 she was already a published author and participated eagerly in the struggle, as well as the retreat.\n\nInstead of remaining in Skynavia, however, she departed after the founding of the socialist republic as she felt she could not sit idly in the north and just write. Since then, she had travelled the world - often undercover - as an author and agitator. She especially has taken an interest in the social aspects of the revolution and is as comfortable leading partisans as she is arguing for revised social norms. "
BEAKUNIN_NAME_DESC:0 "Beakunin is one of the oldest and most influential of the griffonian revolutionaries, called a "father of the revolution" by many of his supporters. Born in the Heartlands of the Griffonian empire, Beakunin was in Equestria on a business trip during the early 950s when he met the legendary Caramel Marks. The sharp-witted young griffon caught Caramel Marks' attention and Beakunin was a quick and attentive learner. He was, however, not a very orthodox student and clashed ceaselessly with the old pony on matters of ideology and method. During the griffonian revolution he was one of the most important leaders and, along with Sickleclaw, was the leader during the retreat north.\n\nHe departed when it was clear the Skynavian Socialist Republic would focus on rebuilding and recovering rather than pursue the expansion of the Socialist Revolution worldwide, and has since then helped train and organize revolutionaries wherever needed. He may be in his eighties, but he will not stop as long as he can move."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

SRS_debates_1d_desc:0 "Unlike the decadent bourgeois societies of Herzland, Aquileia, or Wingbardy, where the rich enjoy the fruits of technological progress whilst the poor starve in their hovels nearby, the people of Skynavia shall have equal access to whatever scientific advances made by their brethren. Our technological marvels may be few, but they will serve the many, not the few."
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_1e_desc:0 "The opportunity to work towards the advancement of science should be open to all who desire it.

SRS_debates_1g_desc:0 "Recognising the proliferation of radio technology in Skynavia, and the potency of such technology, the General Congress has convened to formulate a plan to utilise the power of wireless communication for the betterment of Skynavian society.

SRS_debates_1h:0 "No More Drudgery"
SRS_debates_1h_desc:0 "What is drudge work? Definitions vary, but generally it is agreed that such refers to coerced, hierarchical, or boring work.

We shall now debate how to resolve the problem of undesirable work in our society in a fair, democratic, and open manner."
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Democracy through Centralism"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of democratic centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Democracy through Confederalism"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict.

SRS_debates_2d:0 "Giving A Voice For The Masses"
SRS_debates_2d_desc:0 "The right to take part in direct democracy is already available to the Skynavian citizen, who has access to the weekly assemblies of their local People's Council.

SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_2e_desc:0 "We must make sure that the right to a decent and comprehensive education is fulfilled for the people of Skynavia.

SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "A Permanent Revolution"

SRS_debates_3g:0 "Enshrining the Commons"
SRS_debates_3g_desc:0 "There is no privately-held land in Skynavia; all land use is based on usufruct, where everyone has a right to use any unutilised land if it does not infringe on the wellbeing of others. Admittedly, the lack of concrete rules on such informal land use allows for no small amount of misunderstanding. The General Congress votes on the proposed Internationalist and Communalist reforms."
SRS_debates_3h:0 "All Are Equal"
SRS_debates_3h_desc:0 "The General Congress, though a wholly democratic institution open to the people, remains an elusive bastion of state power to many, in particular the commune dwellers in the Hail Forest and elsewhere. They may care little about the Congress, but we must care for them as our kin. We must further liberalise the Congress, and Skynavian society in general, so that all may participate."

SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the backwards Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters.

SRS_war_2_desc:0 "The ponies we are fighting against are members of an oppressed social group, misled into dying for their tribal leaders.

SRS_war_3:0 "Ending the Conflict"
SRS_war_3_desc:0 "The Northern Tribes are no more. Having freed the tribesponies from their shackles, we must now allow them their freedom to rebuild and remould their society in the socialist image. Of course, we will be there to help them through this difficult transition."
SRS_war_4:0 "From the Ashes of Tribalism..."
SRS_war_4_desc:0 "We have the responsibility to share with our comrades up north all our technological prowess, so they too may benefit, as our brothers and sisters in the revolutionary cause, from the fruits of socialist progress."

SRS_war_5_desc:0 "At the culmination of a great deal of hard work, perseverance, and sacrifice, both on our part and by our pony brethren up north, we have succeeded in developing the territories of the former Northern Tribes through the doctrine of socialism. By democratic vote, the Far Northern Republic shall be established to herald a new era of socialism in the North!"
SRS_military_tree:0 "The Skynavian People's Army"
SRS_military_tree_desc:0 "That the army of Skynavia belongs to the people is indisputable.

SRS_military_4:0 "Popular Control of the Military"
SRS_military_4_desc:0 "The military must remain subordinate to the will of the people if the ideals of democratic socialism are to be preserved throughout all aspects of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia. A horizontalised command structure will be integral to preserving democracy both within and outside of the military."
SRS_military_5:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
SRS_military_5_desc:0 "Discipline is the glue that holds the military together. The militias of the communes can enjoy their autonomy, but the powers of the military high command must be strengthened if we want to fight and win in the revolutionary struggle to come."
SRS_military_a:0 "The Strong Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_a_desc:0 "The advent of armoured tank combat taking place on Equus and Griffonia heralds the beginning of a new age of warfare. The potency of this new aspect of war should not be overlooked, and hence we must pursue development immediately."
SRS_military_b:0 "The Long Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_b_desc:0 "Socialism on the High Seas! The socialist revolution shall take to the waves in order to liberate the proletariat of the nations across the ocean in Equus. More importantly, a navy allows us to keep our coastline safe and defend our home from seaborne invasion."
SRS_industry_tree:0 "Consolidate the Means of Production"
SRS_industry_tree_desc:0 "In Skynavia, there are no bosses or capitalists, and the people work for the betterment of society, and of each other, under no coercion or forced labour. The means of production are already in the possession of the proletariat, and so we can now focus on a measured and sustainable industrialisation that centres the wellbeing of the people as the goal of progress."
SRS_industry_1:0 "Autonomous Cooperatives"
SRS_industry_1_desc:0 "The first thing we should do is to formalise the status of the many autonomous cooperatives found all across Skynavia. While the management structure, scope, and scale of these cooperatives vary greatly, they are all united in their egalitarian approach to producing value out of their labour."
SRS_industry_2:0 "Independent Workers' Councils"
SRS_industry_2_desc:0 "The concept of workers' councils may be a holdover from when labour was still controlled by the capitalists, but these councils still serve an invaluable function to Skynavian democracy by allowing for an independent grassroots organisation of the masses."
SRS_industry_3:0 "By the People, For the People, Of the People"
SRS_industry_3_desc:0 "There is little sense to maintain the concept of private ownership over land, considering the lack of capitalist predation on the livelihoods of the proletariat in Skynavian society. We should encourage and propagate the idea of the public's shared responsibility to maintain and make use of the land in the communities, for the common good."
SRS_industry_4:0 "Feeding the People"
SRS_industry_4_desc:0 "The icy tundras making up most of Skynavia are hardly suited to agriculture. But by working together and applying agrarian socialist concepts to the development of arable land, the spirit of solidarity and perseverance shall soon allow us to achieve a hard-earned autarky."
SRS_industry_5:0 "Educating the People"
SRS_industry_5_desc:0 "By creating a network of communal schools, forming an organisation of travelling specialists, and writing up new school curriculums that allow for greater freedom and personal development, we will soon be able to bring education to the people of Skynavia efficiently and on a large scale."
SRS_industry_a:0 "Arming the People"
SRS_industry_a_desc:0 "Attention should be paid to the construction of communal armouries and gunsmiths, so each community, collective, and commune within Skynavia will each be capable of protecting their homes themselves."
SRS_industry_b:0 "Nurturing the People"
SRS_industry_b_desc:0 "The development gap between the urbanised areas of New Skynavia and the independent communes filling up the rest of Skynavia must be addressed.

SRS_diplomacy_tree:0 "Socialism In Our Time"
SRS_diplomacy_tree_desc:0 "It is essential for all the socialist nations of the world to be united in our shared fight for the international revolution and the liberation of our oppressed comrades abroad.

SRS_diplomacy_1:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
SRS_diplomacy_1_desc:0 "The benevolence of the monarchist rule in Vedina does not hide the fact that it is still an instrument of class oppression that has created and actively maintains an unjust status quo. We must decide now on how to intervene in Vedina to liberate its proletariat from the shackles of feudalism and monarchism."
SRS_diplomacy_2:0 "Our Comrades in Need"
SRS_diplomacy_2_desc:0 "Decades ago, we had split with the Republicans in Cloudbury over their refusal to share power with the people they profess to be liberating. Their centralisation of power within an exclusive cadre of the military cost them the support of the people, contributing to the failure of the First Griffonian Revolution. We must reclaim the revolutionary ideal for the proletariat!"
SRS_diplomacy_3:0 "Internationalist Brigades"
SRS_diplomacy_3_desc:0 "Both sides of the Congress have agreed on a policy where foreign fighters for the revolutionary socialist cause are to be welcomed to Skynavia as fellow comrades and brothers in arms.

The first of these Brigades to be created will be the Lions of Skynavia, formed by the hardened veterans of many a socialist insurrection abroad."
SRS_diplomacy_4:0 "Friendship of Species"

SRS_diplomacy_5:0 "Welcome the Exiles"
SRS_diplomacy_5_desc:0 "Three prominent revolutionaries - Emma Goldgriff, Mikhail Beakunin, and Pierre Ponehon - once departed from the Socialist Republic of Skynavia a long time ago, citing the lack of action to liberate the oppressed of our neighbouring countries.

SRS_look_to_the_stars:0 "§HLooking to the Stars§!"
SRS_look_to_the_stars_desc:0 "For millennia, griffons have looked up at the night sky, admiring the beauty of the stars. The ponies in Equus may worship the Sun and Moon with a quasi-religious fervour, but to the atheistic griffons of Skynavia, it is the prospect of reaching the distant stars that resonates most deeply with the revolutionaries; after all, this too is but another fantastical dream waiting to be realised."
SRS_a_united_griffonia:0 "§HOne Griffonia Under Socialism§!"
SRS_a_united_griffonia_desc:0 "Our recent successes in promoting the socialist cause abroad have proved that our revolutionary ideal of international socialism is bearing fruit.

SRS_the_magic_of_socialism_desc:0 "For most of history, magic has been the preserve of the bourgeoisie. In ancient Equus, the unicorns were the ruling class for centuries, dominating other races through their magic. Even today, the fruits of enchantment magic remain available only to the richest of Griffonia. Now, we shall free the supernatural forces of magic from the machinery of capitalism, making it accessible to all who desire it."

SRS_purge_1:0 "§RSocialism has Failed us§!"
SRS_purge_1_desc:0 "The failure of the socialist leadership to guide our nation through the hardships of war has left the population thoroughly disillusioned with the Republic's founding dream of a socialist utopia. This gives us breathing space to consolidate our power. However, the much of the nation's youth have only known a life under socialism, and our power grab may soon backfire if we fail to pacify the people..."
SRS_purge_2a:0 "Learning to live as Individuals"
SRS_purge_2a_desc:0 "For too long the spirit of the Skynavian individual has been suppressed by the stifling collectivism of socialist ideology.

SRS_purge_2b:0 "Work Camps"
SRS_purge_2b_desc:0 "For the most vocal of the dissidents against our regime, as well as those irrevocably tainted by their association with the socialist ruling apparatus - activists, Congressional delegates, teachers, philosophers, and community leaders - there is no option but to resign their fates to the work camps, where they may perhaps see the error of their ways through the virtues of hard labour."
SRS_purge_2c:0 "Labour Units"
SRS_purge_2c_desc:0 "To supplant the failed socialist system of workers' cooperatives and collectives, a system will be implement where individuals are grouped, according to their physical ability, geographical proximity, and other factors, into Labour Units where the social functions of work, sustenance, and community all take place within the Unit."
SRS_purge_3a:0 "Army Decimations"
SRS_purge_3a_desc:0 "The infusion of political ideology into military doctrine enforced by the socialist regime has led to the stagnation of our armed forces. To break free from the spinelessness of the old military, we will unfortunately have to rid ourselves of the officers and theorists, as well as those rank-and-file, clinging onto the old ways. A tenth of all personnel will be liquidated."
SRS_purge_3b:0 "Decentralised Fear"
SRS_purge_3b_desc:0 "To further hammer in the finality of our split from socialism into the public consciousness, we will initiate an extensive program of undercover policing and surveilance.

The populace shall redeem themselves from the socialist scourge forthwith."
SRS_purge_4a:0 "Martial Law in Perpetuality"
SRS_purge_4a_desc:0 "The linchpin of our plan to consolidate power is the indefinite extension of the current state of martial law. The most ideologically-pure sections of the armed forces shall be given extensive judicial and governmental authority over civil society, which will hopefully keep the degenerates, thought-traitors, and subversives within our nation in line."
SRS_purge_4b:0 "Overhaul the Education System"
SRS_purge_4b_desc:0 "Education is the tool through which we nurture the next generation of Skynavians. A complete overhaul of our nation's curriculum to excise all socialist influences is imperative to the survival of the regime. Emphasis will be placed on the infusion of values such as order, discipline, and obedience to the state in our students."
SRS_purge_4c:0 "Destroy Subversive Literature"
SRS_purge_4c_desc:0 "The tools through which socialism has infected the minds of the populace is through the media. Censorship will be applied to radio and newspaper, but our attention will mainly be focused on the destruction of subversive and degenerate literature. We shall start by emptying out all the libraries of Skynavia and purging all reading material and associated media compromised by socialist thought."

SRS_commune_1:0 "Picking up the Pieces"
SRS_commune_1_desc:0 "The dream of a socialist utopia in Skynavia was shattered with the persecution and decimation its chief progenitor, the United Socialist Revolutionary Front, by the military junta. But although they once stood idly by as the socialism that nurtured them was trodden into the dirt, the people of Skynavia rallied and reclaimed their home from the forces of reaction. Now, we rebuild what we have lost."
SRS_commune_2a:0 "Dissolving the Army"
SRS_commune_2a_desc:0 "It was the so-called People's Army that aided and abetted Sickleclaw's power grab. They have betrayed the Skynavian people and the international Socialist cause. Traitors that they are, the Army shall be disbanded, the battalions dissolved and their weapons and equipment redistributed, with the Skynavian communes all responsible for their own self-defence. Militarism's taint shall exist no more."
SRS_commune_2b:0 "Exiling the Commanders"
SRS_commune_2b_desc:0 "The Army may have been the main tool of Sickleclaw's oppression, but the fact remains that it was under the leadership of their commanders that they were turned to serve the forces of reaction. The moral culpability for the Army's wrongdoing thus lies with their commanders as well. They shall be exiled for their treacherous crimes, never again allowed to set foot on Skynavian soil."
SRS_commune_2c:0 "Swords into Ploughshares"
SRS_commune_2c_desc:0 "Life under martial law and military oppression has left Skynavia with a bitter distaste towards all militarism.

SRS_commune_3b:0 "Laws Unto Themselves"
SRS_commune_3b_desc:0 "No longer can we consciously expropriate the hard-earned fruits of the labour of our people, not even in the name of collectivism.

SRS_commonwealth_2c_desc:0 "The peasants have been oppressed since before even the founding of socialism. It will behoove us to remember them and to usher in a new age for them as well. It is time to let land be owned by those who work it, and as we all own together, we all work together."

Sickleclaw, with the Revolutionary Front behind him, shall pursue the revitalisation of Skynavian industry."
SRS_beginning_4a:0 "Unite the Communes"
SRS_beginning_4a_desc:0 "A consensus has been reached by the notoriously independent and aloof Communalists that, in order to survive against the reactionary forces massing on our borders, the scattered communes and collectives of Skynavia shall band together for their mutual benefit. The central government is still left with little control over Communalist industry and resources outside of New Skynavia, though."
SRS_beginning_4b:0 "Rein in the Revolutionaries"
SRS_beginning_4b_desc:0 "Ever since we have arrived in Skynavia, the radical Internationalists have been raving to go to war with all our neighbours in the name of the socialist revolution. Their suicidal expansionist tendencies have cooled somewhat since, but with the formation of the General Congress and Sickleclaw's reconciliatory measures, we can finally harness and put their revolutionary ardour to good use."
SRS_beginning_5a:0 "Comradely Cooperation"
SRS_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Although we may not agree with the infuriating indifference displayed by the Hail Forest communes, we recognise that at the end of the day they are still our brothers and sisters. We must seek to work together with them for a nonviolent solution where we will be allowed to conduct troop movements within the forest. This will be a lengthy process but we all trust in the solidarity of the Skynavian people."
SRS_beginning_5b:0 "Reclaiming the Forest"
SRS_beginning_5b_desc:0 "The Hail Forest communes are selfish and individualistic in their refusal to accomodate our defense strategy, to the detriment of the rest of Skynavia. We will tolerate such antisocial behaviour no longer! The ever-decisive Sickleclaw will do the tough thing, and reclaim the forest for the Skynavian people with his loyal soldiers. Many will disagree with our methods, but it is for the greater good."
SRS_beginning_of_the_end:0 "The End of the Beginning"
SRS_beginning_of_the_end_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's reforms are nearing their culmination. Already, the mood in Skynavia is hopeful; with the Revolutionary Front united once more, the Skynavian people can now aspire to greater things. The only thing left to do, then, is for Sickleclaw to step down, formally ceding power to the General Congress. The people of Skynavia shall finally be in full control of their destiny."

SRS_expansion_1a:0 "The Next Generation"
SRS_expansion_1a_desc:0 "The socialist education system that served us in Skynavia so well shall be enjoyed by the children of our neighbour countries as well. We will send volunteer to our neighbours, not only to educate the young griffons and ponies, but to help our friends rebuild their societies in the image of socialism as well. Everyone should take part in this effort, in the spirit of solidarity."
SRS_expansion_1b:0 "Socialist Atomics"
SRS_expansion_1b_desc:0 "Working in concert with scientists from our liberated neighbours, we have begun to unravel the mysteries of the atom, and the power that lie therin. When we finally achieve our breakthroughs, will the godlike power of the split atom be put to use for the good of all creaturekind, or as the hammer of the people against the forces of reaction?"
SRS_expansion_1c:0 "The Crusade Continues"
SRS_expansion_1c_desc:0 "We have consolidated our power sufficiently in the north to plan for the liberation of the Griffonian Heartlands. After decades in exile following the First Griffonian Revolution, the socialists of Skynavia are now faced with the prospect of returning home. Let us set our sights on that penultimate bastion of monarchism, the Imperial City itself, and charge forwards in the name of socialism!"

SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Three times each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhelming majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

SRS_approach_hail_forest_communes_desc:0 "The sparsely-populated and undeveloped Hail Forest is home to dozens of autonomous communes, detached from the General Congress in New Skynavia and existing in a de-facto state of independence.

socrep_grif.1.t:0 "The Conference of the United Socialist Revolutionary Front"
socrep_grif.1.d:0 "From all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, both urban centers and rural communities, if such terms can even be used for the frozen north, they gathered. Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new, as the two political factions of the Skynavian Socialist Republic: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed and have spent most of the Skynavian history being more occupied with their own endeavors both within the Socialist Republic and beyond it's borders instead of attempting to implement their ideals across the country.\n\nBut this time seems different from any similar attempts of getting these groups to collaborate which happened before. Due to the efforts of Asper Sickleclaw, however, both these groups have understood that in such a cruel and unforgiving age, coexistence and cooperation is the only way of survival."
socrep_grif.1.a:0 "Let's hope this works out."
socrep_grif.2.t:0 "Socialism and the Way we Live"
socrep_grif.2.d:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has already existed for several decades, yet we posses very few industrial centers and even those are greatly lacking. With our citizens possessing so few factories, our country is in a very dangerous position. Even in our current geographical position we are not only surrounded by more powerful enemies, but most of our history has been spent waging a war against the Northern Tribes for decades. If we wish to survive the coming decades, a large and modern industrial base is a necessity. However the revolutionaries of our republic do not wish to survive, they seek to liberate the all workers of Griffonia, a task which will require even greater industrial capacity. Thus we cannot limit our industrialization and risk not only everything we have achieved till this point, but also the free future of the workers of the world.\n\nWith the members of the Internationalist coalition providing such convincing arguments, the General Congress has decided to support the policies and laws on industrialization proposed by the association. With the enactment of this decision some limitations which were previously placed in order to limit expansion of production facilities will be removed. Furthermore the leadership of the country will invest in acquiring new and advanced machinery in order to improve production of both civilian produce and military equipment.\n\nHowever it seems that quite a few previous supporters of the Internationalists have criticized the, as they claim, rash and short-sighted, decisions and policies which they believe will eventually lead to ecological collapse which will doom the world."
socrep_grif.2.a:0 "There can be no Utopia in the future if one gives away the present."
socrep_grif.3.t:0 "Socialism and the Air we Breathe"
socrep_grif.3.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has only existed for a few decades, one can already easily see the effects that hundreds of thousands of new inhabitants and the expansion and establishment of both new cities and centers of production had on the environment, especially the locations with most urbanization. Already there are some places with extremely fragile local ecosystems where the expansion of production facilities might lead to permanent damage. With such a crisis becoming a potential reality, the General Congress has decided that strict limitations and guidelines on how the process of industrial expansion should be performed in our country must be implemented. Furthermore this set of laws will not only limit industrialization, but will also reduce the amount of chaotic expansion that is currently happening in the few urban centers of our country. After all it's well know, even in the Frozen North, that modern cities have an extremely negative effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nOf course some internationalists opposed such a decision, claiming that by slowing down and limiting our industrialization we are weakening ourselves and thus endangering our freedom and independence. While many share similar fears, it was decided that it's better to risk the present than doom the future."
socrep_grif.3.a:0 "What is the point of Utopia if the future generations can't enjoy it?"
socrep_grif.4.t:0 "Democracy, Unity, Progress"
socrep_grif.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the Communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a system where even the concept of a "political party" is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."
socrep_grif.4.a:0 "Progress and unity are necessities if we wish to survive."
socrep_grif.5.t:0 "A Democracy of the Masses"
socrep_grif.5.d:0 "While the arguments of the few more statist leaning representatives about the potential factionalism and the weakening of the republic in the event of an even more radical variation of democracy is implemented have been quite convincing and will definitely lead to some communities joining the Internationalist side the moment the new system shows any flaws, the General Congress has decided that such risk is truly worthy as long as each and every citizen of our republic can truly represent their own interests and ideas on the political stage. Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."
socrep_grif.5.a:0 "Finally, the masses can thrive!"
socrep_grif.6.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to All"
socrep_grif.6.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical communalists and anarchists, the General Congress has decided that if we wish to achieve the true socialist goal of world revolution, some compromises need to be made. Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."
socrep_grif.6.a:0 "Another step towards worker's liberation!"
socrep_grif.7.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to The People"
socrep_grif.7.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical internationalists and vanguardists, the General Congress has decided that in order to create a truly free and prosperous society, an even more anti-statist stance needs to be taken. While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don't truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies.\n\nHowever, it seems that several of the communities which had previously supported our goal of a Libertarian Socialist Utopia, have been persuaded by the internationalist arguments and have embraced their goal of a world revolution."

Already, she was looking forward to school, not only because she would be seeing her friends, but also because classes were always enjoyable and engaging, although she always got splinters during the woodworking sessions, and found the political theory often being the topic of discussion in class complicated and complex.\n\nAlthough she may not have realised it at the time, Starflank would grow up having experienced the new socialist school curriculum implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, being educated into a member of the proletariat conscious and critical of the socialist governance at home, and the importance of the class struggle taking place in nations abroad."

However, as most of the country is comprised of frozen tundra, both communication between the various communities and enacting country-wide policies used to be difficult tasks. However the spreading of radio technology across the country, assisted by the central leadership, has allowed us to eliminate this problem as now every community can properly communicate with New Skynavia. This also allows the People's Councils to indirectly participate in making laws and enacting policies as they can now directly listen to how the General Council comes to it's decisions and how they are justified. One could claim that the entire populace of Socialist Republic of Skynavia is directly present at the debates which determine the future of the country.\n\nProviding every community with at least one radio has also created opportunities which weren't even thought about when the policy was being enacted.

This means that not all communes, collectives and cooperatives posses or lack access to any communal higher institutions of learning, thus thousands of Skynavian citizens lack the chance to access tertiary education. Not only does this limit the life opportunities of our citizens, but also negatively impacts the military, scientific and industrial capabilities of our country. Thus the General Congress, in a rare moment of complete agreement between the Internationalist and Communalist coalitions has decided to establish the greatest institution of higher education within our republic - The People's University of Skynavia. Any citizen of our republic will be allowed to attend this university, for free of course, and they will be provided with living quarters if they don't have a local location to stay. We will gather the best and most qualified specialists from both inside the republic and abroad in order to bring knowledge to the inquisitive citizens from all across the country.

With such a goal in mind it might seem strange for the General Congress, which is currently being comprised of mostly communalists, to decide that a country-wide network of railroads needs to be constructed. After all such a campaign would require great amounts of resources and could potentially result in substantial amounts of pollution being produced. However the benefits from this would greatly help in creating a sustainable and ecological system. Most importantly, this will provide the citizens of Skynavia the ability to traverse the country without having to rely on other, more polluting or dangerous ways of travelling across the frozen tundra. Furthermore it will allow easier transportation of modern equipment and machinery.

Thus the various collectives, communes and cooperatives scattered across the territories of the republic will be supplied with the most modern and numerous technology and equipment available. This will allow these communities, with some help from the central government in organizing such an endeavor, begin the long and difficult process of expanding the already existing industrial centers and establishment of new ones.

If the revolution was to be a true revolution, it was incumbent upon its champions to rethink more than just systems of governance. \n\nHow did they view those who loved in non-traditional ways such as those who found love with another species, whether of not it produced an offspring? Did they cling to idea that relationships were strictly monogamous affairs? If a new world was truly to come, questions such as these would need to be answered.

All of this did very little to make the famous radical more charitable in his disposal and when an obstinate policegriffon questioned his papers Ponehon headbutted him unconscious before marching to the congress. \n\nIt was swiftly made clear that Ponehon's views had not softened during his years abroad, fighting in both Longsword and Prywhen, indeed they may well have been reinforced. He made it clear to the congress from the beginning that he would only accept any role that was bestowed on him by his fellow revolutionary fighters - the day he became a fat, commissioned  \"general\" that sat away from the front lines and above his fellow socialists was the day he swallowed a grenade. \n\nAll the same, though; he was happy to be back.

In the end though, nature won out when a sudden blast of wind tore his papers away and sent them flying. Beakunin's response was to sigh and depart for congress, waving to the somewhat befuddled crowd as he left.\n\nAt the congress the old revolutionary spoke of his journeys throughout Griffonia, including his experiences in Aquilea during the recent revolution. He saluted what the congress and the Skynavian socialists had managed to achieve, yet did not shy away from voicing concerns as well. He had not come back to fawn over them, after all, but do his part to turn this place to the best it could be. \n\nHe was getting up in his years, he said, and if there was one place where he wanted to die it was on the barricades."

The population has chafed under the increasingly brutal military dictatorship of Asper Sickleclaw, formerly an esteemed revolutionary war hero, now vilified as a reactionary and traitor to the Socialist Revolution.\n\nThe efforts of the military junta ruling over Skynavia to crush dissent and cement their regime have been harsh and suppressive, with many revolutionaries and activists being imprisoned, sent into exile, or even executed. For a while, it seemed that the people of Skynavia had accepted their lot in life, along with the military junta's narrative that the Socialist Revolution in Skynavia had failed its people.\n\nThis rather depressive view of things, however, would soon prove to be false, as in the early hours of the morning, a great crowd of griffons, ponies, and other creatures marched onto the building complex that formerly housed the General Congress of Skynavia. Demanding an end to Sickleclaw's dictatorial rule, the crowd was allowed to proceed unchallenged by sympathetic military units who had had enough of the authoritarian military regime. They successfully and safely reached the headquarters of Sickleclaw's regime, but were fired upon in an ambush by a cadre of officers loyal to Sickleclaw. The ensuring close-quarters combat, fought with paving stones and placards against rifles and a machine-gun emplacement, ended with the defeat of this last-ditch defence of the military regime.\n\nThe corpse of Sickleclaw, who had shot himself in his office, was retrieved and strung up on a lamppost, and the rest of his staff were imprisoned by the victorious revolutionaries, whilst army units elsewhere in the country were disarmed when the news of the successful revolt reached the rest of Skynavia.\n\nAs a successor to the defunct Socialist Republic of Skynavia, the Commune of Skynavia has arisen with the promise of a new era of libertarian and democratic Socialist governance."

Civilian authority is all but disbanded, except for where it serves as a convenient accessory to the military, and Sickleclaw now serves as Dictator of the Republic.\n\nOrder has finally been imposed on the nation through the only way that truly works, brute force, and it is kept in place through strict policing and unforgiving punishments. Despite this, however, there is neither time nor reason to relax. Socialism is an insidious thing and it can grow where you least expect it. Therefore, martial law will be extended indefinitely, until such a time that Sickleclaw deems it no longer necessary.\n\nAll is quiet in Skynavia. The military patrols pass unharassed through the capital city's neighbourhoods, even those which had once been hotbeds of radical socialist movements. The assembly halls are all boarded up; some have been repurposed as impromptu prisons by the military. The anarcho-primitivist communes deep within the Hail Forest have been rooted out and eradicated, their members scattered to the winds.\n\nBut the people of Skynavia remember. They remember life as it had been under the Socialist Republic. And they remember the lofty ideals of the International Socialist Revolution.\n\nIt might take years, or even decades, of struggle. But deep within the hearts of every creature in Skynavia, from the lowliest political dissident rotting in a prison cell, to Asper Sickleclaw himself, is the knowledge that the military regime will not last - someday, freedom and democracy shall return to the icy lands of Skynavia."

Did he resent his superior for it? Not really, if he had faith in nothing else, he had faith in Asper. The griffon had led them this far and would lead them further, it was just so... tedious!\n\nHe remembered the march north, the struggle to get Skynavia secured and and the battles against the Northern Tribes. There had been a purpose to work for, hopes and dreams to fufill. He had been part of a greater cause and built something new. And yet it was all gone now, swept away and declared a huge mistake.

Unnerved, she hurried up to get home, not wanting to remain outside and longer than needed.\n\nScenes like these were everywhere nowadays, ever since the new laws on reporting dissident activity, people had realized that anyone could be an informant. Only after a few months, almost every creature in Skynavia knew someone who had been snatched up by the secret police, and in too many cases, these people were never seen again. Was the pony a dissident trying to avoid detection? Was the griffon behind the curtain an informant? Nobody knew for sure, and bit by bit, people realized just how vulnerable they were.

In the frontier commune of Old Dragon, an elderly librarian, after putting up an armed resistance with an old revolver against the soldiers defiling the library, was bayoneted and left to perish in the flames.\n\nThe confiscated books reached New Skynavia by train, ferry, balloon, and muscle transport. There, they were piled in a great heap at the centre of the city square in a pile reaching ten meters high. In the presence of a large part of the city's populace, the books were doused in gasoline, before being set aflame.\n\nThose in the crowd who were angered or otherwise upset by this act of cultural, literary, and political censorship were obliged to keep their subversive thoughts to themselves, because of the armed guards and machine-gun emplacements watching over the crowd.\n\nThe great bonfire continued to burn well into the evening, the great licks of smoke and flame rising from the burning books combining with the last rays of sunlight that painted the evening sky a fiery amber."

None in the unit moved a single muscle as the old griffon was tied to the post, struggling and emitting muffled protests as his arms were bound behind the post and the MPs stepped back.

Tossing it over his shoulder, he walked out to the door where two militiagriffs waited for him. Without a word, they escorted him through the streets towards the docks and as he walked, he could see faces, familiar faces, that looked towards him with suspicion and even hatred. He didn't really blame them.\n\nWhen on the ship, he got below deck and sat down, staring listlessly out of the window as the ship started to slowly depart from what for so many years had been his home now. Beyond the duffle bag by his side, he had nothing to his name. He could not go back home to Griffenheim, he was still a socialist traitor.

It should not be a revolutionary concept to truly take care of and listen to the common working class creature, and yet that's where we have been."
socrep_grif.70.a:0 "That's what happens when profit is your only true god."
socrep_grif.71.t:0 "All Brothers and Sisters"
socrep_grif.71.d:0 ""Us" and "them" are one of the most fundamental - and thus most dangerous - divisions of the sapient creature's mind. It puts up barriers between creatures who share so much in common, barriers to which post-hoc justifications can be applied later. "They are workshy" or "they are violent" or simply "they are evil". Condemnation takes the place of understanding and sooner or later, you have a division that can cause outright wars; and all because you once would not call these creatures your brothers and sisters for whatever reason.\n\nWe cannot ever do away with this division fully, but we can aim to mitigate it. Terms like "Aquileian" or "Greifwalder" or "Wingbardian" will be relegated to the annals of history and we will, in all things, reject the very notion of a nation. If, one day, our children will treat wars between "nations" as just as inane as wars between villages or city blocks, then we will have succeeded in doing away with these mental chains that have caused so much misery and death."
socrep_grif.71.a:0 "There are no nations, there are only free creatures."
socrep_grif.72.t:0 "Flourishing of Cultures"
socrep_grif.72.d:0 "Looking at it soberly, cultures are creations of chance and circumstance more than anything else. This, in turn, means there's no sane reason to not question them, especially when they become divisive. As these things are so precious, however, we must show mindfulness. We are no savages to burn down old temples, ban beloved holidays or belittle and insult that which has bound communities since ancient times. If we do that, we are no better than the worst imperialist.\n\nEmma Goldgriff has written much on this topic, and she says that above all else, we must find that which unites all creatures: things such as the celebration of birth, or remembering the dead, or the dawn of spring and the harvest times. We will work to bind all creatures together around such holidays. We must never coerce but instead entice and let everycreature, whether they are the first or last to participate, they should feel welcome and included as we let these cultures meet and mix to form something new and truly inclusive"
socrep_grif.72.a:0 "Also let's not commercialize the new holidays."
socrep_grif.73.t:0 "Down to the Countryside"
socrep_grif.73.d:0 "We are the thousands who build up this nation\nNo matter how the storms may rage\nThrough war and famine\nThrough grief and suffering\nNow we shall build a brave new age\n\n We have struggled with the issue of the urban-rural divide. The cities cannot become isolated from the countryside that feeds it, and therefore provisions have been left in the constitution so that everycreature, no matter where, may take part in the most fundamental parts of the nation; the sustenance farming and resource extraction. Our dream is that all will be willing and able to participate in these industries, if nothing else to understand how hard the countryside works to feed a modern society. If they do that, they will understand better the foundation upon which all of society rests."
socrep_grif.73.a:0 "It's also healthy for our more sedentary citizens."
socrep_grif.74.t:0 "Remaking Society"
socrep_grif.74.d:0 "Although it was still dark outside, the construction team was already hard at work reconstructing the schoolhouse. Damaged in the devastating Prywhen Civil War, the ruined schoolhouse meant that the children of the surrounding villages had not been receiving a proper education.\n\nFrom time to time, a gaggle of such children would visit the construction workers, bringing them gifts of sweets, drinks, and food from their parents. Despite having been out of school for so long, their manners were still intact, it seemed. Nor was the thirst for learning inherent in all children missing, as the young griffons observed the work of the construction griffons, chattering amongst themselves and with the workers as the day progressed.\n\nThe schoolhouse would be fully rebuilt within a few days, and the children would once again become students, learning under the watchful tutelage of a volunteer teacher from Skynavia.\n\nAlthough there are still many other schoolhouses to be rebuilt, and a myriad of other societal ills plaguing the Pan-Griffonian Commonwealth that need solving. Cities and towns damaged by war need to be rebuilt, their surrounding fire-scorched farmlands revitalised, and the broken web of railroads linking all of Griffonia together restitched. The stalled industrialisation of Griffonia will have to be started anew, with proper care taken in respect to the natural environment and the creatures living within. But with each inch of progress gained through our hard work, the Commonwealth shall become more like the socialist utopia that the people of Griffonia deserve."
socrep_grif.74.a:0 "The road is long and hard, but we shall persevere and succeed."
socrep_grif.75.t:0 "The Magic of Socialism"
socrep_grif.75.d:0 "The mages are a "natural" elite in some ways. Their powers are as rare as they are potent, and among the Ponies the unicorns have been in essence been the nobility due to their unique control of it; case in point - the Diarchy.\n\nIt is therefore all the more laudable that so many mages have rejected the thrones that stood waiting for them and instead come to stand side by side with the downtrodden. From low-caste Diamond Dog warlocks to unicorns who found themselves disgusted by the decadence of their fellow magic users, we have received magic users from all over the world who are now building a new revolutionary tradition where the fruits of magic will be something enjoyed by all creatures, as should be with all things in the world. The socialist ideals of solidarity and kinship, with their power to unite all creatures regardless of their species, class, or ability, may turn out to be the greatest magic of all."  
socrep_grif.75.a:0 "We salute our Magical Comrades!"
socrep_grif.76.t:0 "Celebrating the New Year"
socrep_grif.76.d:0 "It has been a difficult year in the north, not the least due to the war that was fought between us and the Northern Tribes. Blood has been spilled and much grief still fills all our hearts. Yet, this is precisely why we've decided to celebrate this new year together with them. We cannot just move on, thinking that our comrades of the northern tribe will shrug and forget the pains of the war.\n\n All over the north, Skynavians have travelled, bringing food aplenty for the celebration ahead alongside entertainment. We will not force ourselves in though, if we truly are not welcome we leave the gifts and depart. In most cases though, our comrades greet us and let us inside to celebrate the last evening of the old year, and as another year slowly comes around it greets us all, together, with hopes for a better future for everycreature."
socrep_grif.76.a:0 "Peace and Goodwill to All."
socrep_grif.77.t:0 "The Debate about Work"
socrep_grif.77.d:0 "The Skynavian creature works, not because they have to do so to survive, but because they desire to work and contribute to the society they live in.\n\n"From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs". One is free to apply their natural initiative to work, their spontaneous creative energy, to whatever purpose they see fit - a luxury afforded to the people of Skynavia, whose talents are not in thrall to the coercive systems of wage labour, indentured servitude, or worse, slavery, in the capitalist countries. To further develop this philosophy, Communalist thinkers have called for the devolution of all menial labour to individual communities and households, so that all can shoulder the burden of the undesirable, yet necessary, work needed to keep society running - garbage collection, sanitation, cleaning and maintenance of public spaces, and the like. No longer shall there be a permanent underclass resigned to performing such drudgery on behalf of a thankless bourgeoisie, and all shall partake in the cultivation of their own living environments.\n\nOn the other hand, the foremost Internationalist ideologues have argued that we should instead focus our efforts on affirming the necessity of military service in the defense of the Skynavian homeland, with measures taken to appeal to the collectivist ethos adopted by the Skynavian people so as to compel the pacifists, individualist anarchists, and the detached commune-dwellers of the Republic to partake in a few years of military service, in the militias if not in the "professional" army.\n\nIt has now come to a vote in the General Congress. What shall the outcome be?"

They say it will promote solidarity between socialists all around the world, emphasising the need for us revolutionaries to stand together against the reactionary tide in this grim world. Our leaders are in debate whether or not to accept their offer, and the advantages and disadvantages that invariably entail."
socrep_grif.78.a:0 "Yes, we'll join the Socialist International."
socrep_grif.78.b:0 "No, we think we'll pass for now."

socrep_grif.80.t:0 "Our offer was refused"
socrep_grif.80.d:0 "The leaders of [From.GetName] have turned down our offer to join the Socialist International. Whilst we are of course disappointed, we respect their decision. Of course, we can send them the offer again; perhaps in time, they will accept."

socrep_grif.82.t:0 "The Northern Star Shines Bright"
socrep_grif.82.d:0 "The Socialists of Skynavia have succeeded in their ambition to liberate the oppressed creatures of Vedina, Cloudbury, and the Northern Tribes. Rebuilding from the carnage of the military conflicts that had toppled their reactionary, authoritarian governments will not be easy, but with the solidarity from each other, the societies of the Griffonian north shall heal their wounds, and cast their societies in the image of socialist utopianism.\n\nWith their recent victories, the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has gained infamy around the world as a bastion of socialist revolution - or expansionism, depending on who you ask. Nonetheless, their revolutionary efforts have earnt the Republic the title of "the Northern Star" of Socialism. The world watches in anticipation as the northern Socialists set their gazes on the Griffonian Heartlands."

socrep_grif.83.t:0 "Peace in the North"
socrep_grif.83.d:0 "With the Skynavian intervention in the territories of the Northern Tribes, the indigenous ponies have found themselves living under a new socialist regime. Everyone hopes that, along with their newfound allies and friends from Skynavia, the Northern Tribes can rebuild from the ashes of the recent war, and live in peace, harmony, and prosperity under the light of socialism.\n\nThe Northern War has finally ended with the forces of socialism triumphant, and both the Northern Tribes and Skynavia now enter into a new chapter of their relationship."

The Internationalists howl for a liberatory war against Vedina, the Northern Tribes, and the Griffonian Republic, while the Communalists tolerate no interference in the workings of their isolated communes outside of New Skynavia. The Revolutionary Front has become disunited, and Sickleclaw, whose grip on power loses legitimacy by the day, must seek to reconcile both sides of the divide. Only then will Skynavia be able to live up to its potential as one of the few socialist states in the world."

socrep_grif.85.d:0 "With the construction of more and more paved roads connecting the disjunct communes and settlements of Skynavia, the people of the Republic and getting more drawn together. Many communes now no longer live in isolation with each other.\n\nThe recommencement of construction projects in New Skynavia included a series of public apartment blocks. Although quite spartan in furnishing and appearance, these new housing units will provide shelter for the Communalist and Internationalist cadres streaming into the city from all over Skynavia to participate in the formation of the General Congress. People are coming together to make New Skynavia flourish, and for this newfound unity we all have Sickleclaw to thank. His methods may be unyielding and he brooks no argument, but he gets things done!"
socrep_grif.85.a:0 "Now we are all neighbours."
socrep_grif.86.t:0 "The First Session of the General Congress"
socrep_grif.86.d:0 "The General Congress — set up as the soon-to-be governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, after Sickleclaw steps down — has become almost instantaneously divided between the Communalists, who desire an introspective development of libertarian socialism at home, and the Internationalists, who have not forgotten their heritage as the harbingers of socialist revolution. But both factions remain resolute in their shared mission — that is, to strive for the full realisation of socialism wherever possible, and in achieving this goal they will work together in peace and harmony. Everyone hopes that the nascent General Congress will be up to the quite momentous task of providing genuine democratic governance to the people of Skynavia; the first session of the Congress was chaotic and raucous, as Internationalist and Communalist delegates orated, shouted, cheered and booed in a tumult of political discussion yet to be restricted by protocols and decorum.\n\nOf course, all this idealism is premised on the notion that Sickleclaw, when the time comes, will gracefully cede his authority to the General Congress. Surely, someone as steadfast in the socialist cause like him will have no hesitation to cedeing power to the people."
socrep_grif.86.a:0 "Democracy of the masses."
socrep_grif.87.t:0 "Back to Work"
socrep_grif.87.d:0 "Skynavian industry has suffered in the indecisive years between the formation of the Republic and the current day, where the Internationalists and Communalists have squabbled and refused to work with each other, to the detriment of Skynavian industry. Now that Sickleclaw is making an effort to reconcile the two sides, industrial development has picked up the pace. Internationalist expertise mingles with the raw materials and griffonpower of the Communalists to produce consumer goods and rifles in the newly-retooled factories of New Skynavia and elsewhere."
socrep_grif.87.a:0 "The Gears of Progress are turning."
socrep_grif.88.t:0 "All Power to the Congress!"
socrep_grif.88.d:0 ""All Power to the Congress!" "Democracy for the Masses!" "Elections and Suffrage for All!"\n\nThese were only a few of the slogans being chanted by the procession heading down the wide boulevard towards Sickleclaw's headquarters, where the interim government of Skynavia had its offices. The mood was amiable and cheerful, and the procession was a festive occasion rather than a restive one; after all, everyone expected Sickleclaw to cede power to the General Congress. To the people in the crowd, Skynavia seemed to be on the verge of greatness, where the newly-reconciled Internationalists and Communalists would work together in the General Congress towards a new era.\n\nFrom his office, Sickleclaw watches the procession. Surveying the fruits of his labour to revive the socialist dream in Skynavia, his expression is seemingly content. But the slight smile he wears does not reach his eyes, which harbour some unfathomable expression.\n\nWhat does Sickleclaw do?"
socrep_grif.88.a:0 "Yes, all Power to the Congress!"
socrep_grif.88.b:0 "I should stay in power a bit longer."

socrep_grif.89.d:0 "Following the surprise announcement by Sickleclaw that he would be staying in power for some time longer, the delegates of the General Congress have banded together to draft an request to Sickleclaw formally requesting his cecession of power to the Congress. Surely, his peculiar decision the other day was just a fluke, and Sickleclaw would assent?"
socrep_grif.89.a:0 "Alright, I'll step down."
socrep_grif.89.b:0 "Those upstarts in the Congress know nothing!"
socrep_grif.90.t:0 "The Congress Revolts!"
socrep_grif.90.d:0 "Sickleclaw's declaration that he would remain as ruler of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia came as a shock to all, and perhaps to himself as well. Proclaiming his long years in service of the socialist cause, Sickleclaw assented that under his rule, Skynavia would be brought into a new era of prosperity, free from the petty squabbles of the Internationalists and Socialists.\n\nHis decision was at total odds with the direction Skynavia had been taking over the past few months. The masses are out on the streets, and the army's loyalty is already proving untrustworthy.\n\nSickleclaw has mobilised his most loyal supporters, whilst the rebels rally around the banner of the General Congress. The dream of utopia in Skynavia has diverged, and both sides shall fight for their ideals."

Henceforth, authority over our territories will be transferred unto a reorganised Government of Skynavia, so that under my leadership we may all one day break free from the shackles of primitivism."\n\nThe crowd, most of whom were still largely in shock from the recent civil war, could only muster weak applause for Sickleclaw's proclamation."

I like black bread, what do you like?" he passed the question on, some of the kids beginning to talk and deciding white bread was better.\n\n"This is the important thing," the old griffon told them, cutting up pieces of the bread to give out to the children. "You all must eat, right? You need it as much as you need to breathe. If you do not get it, you will die. Can you imagine if someone sold you air to breathe, and if you did not get it you would die. You can't do that, so why do we do it with food? How many of you have starved, even when there was food, just because you didn't have money?" Too many of the children raised their claws at this and the old griffon nodded. "Food is a right, not a commodity. Remember this children, because as long as we're here, you will not starve if we can help it.""

socrep_grif.96.d:0 "They come out of the forest almost like wraiths, moving amidst the snowy branches without even disturbing them. At first it seemed just like one, but it turned out to be dozens and even hundreds coming out of the woods, many of them loaded with heavy backpacks or bundles. Below, in the river valley, the local farmers didn't even see the griffons and ponies above until they were right in front of them.\n\nInitially, fear and surprise made the villagers flee or scramble after whatever weapons they had, but a call from the large group of creatures stilled the worst worries. "We have food!" the newcomers called as they came closer, some of the villagers recognizing the figures as members of the reclusive Hail Forest peoples. What did they do here more than one griffon asked, but when the newcomers showed that they indeed had not only food but also brought tools and indeed warm winter tents, the questions became less important.\n\nThe dour forest folk began work directly, helping the villagers rebuild their homes, restocking larders and granaries and making sure to help those weakened by famine or disease after the war that had raged.\n\n"Why are you doing this?" one villager asked as he watched the foresters repair the roof of his home."We... we've been enemies for centuries..."\n\n "Well, we're siblings now," one of the foresters answered."

"I heard we started shooting first and they fought back..."\n\n"Hey! Haysacks!" a worker yelled from further away. "Are you going to work or what?"\n\n"Yeah yeah..." Hasse said, he and Tage both getting up and get back to work bringing up the logs to the rebuilding.\n\n"Think they'll rebuild Ellens bakery?" Tage asked as they put down one of the logs. "I liked that place."\n\n"Honestly," Hasse said, "I wouldn't be surprised if they made it even better.

Should we agree, we will become a lesser partner in such a Union, where the [From.GetName] will have control over our resources and military, and much more besides.
