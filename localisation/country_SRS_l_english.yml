#### LEADERS ####
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

#### IDEAS ####
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively.

SRS_defend_the_revolution:0 "In the Defense of the Revolution"
SRS_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "We cannot let the evil capitalists crush our revolution, not in battle, nor in the "Unsichtbaren Front". As much as it hurts the core libertarian values of the Skyanvian citizen, an intelligence service must be established, for our own good."
SRS_avenge_986:0 "Avenge 986"
SRS_avenge_986_desc:0 "The 986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic, giving Kemerskai an underclawed victory against Sickleclaw, was the catalyst for the second march north. Now, we shall rid the Cloudburian people from their woes honourably. The Republican authority in Cloudbury has been delcared an illegitimate state, and war is inevitable."
SRS_ntrwar_commie:0 "The Delayed Pacification"
SRS_ntrwar_commie_desc:0 "First step towards breaking the siege is pacifying the tribes who are currently hostile towards us. With them out of the picture, we can srike our southern neighbours while their guard is down."
SRS_far_north_republic:0 "The Far Northern Republic"
SRS_far_north_republic_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we are to face furious resistance in the event of annexation of tribal territory. Therefore, we shall establish the Far Northern Republic, a native rule government, in total obedience to us. Of course, no consctruction projects will take place within the territory of the FNR, to respect the anti-modernity sentiment of the local populace."
SRS_commie_yeetvedina:0 "The End of an Era"
SRS_commie_yeetvedina_desc:0 "Feudalism is one of the greatest evils our revolution has to face. Despite harmonic ideals, the Vedinian system hasn't changed for the entire existence of the Kingdom. Therefore, we are to free the people, and try the former masters for the crimes against the feudal bondsgriffs."
SRS_north_united:0 "The Crimson North"
SRS_north_united_desc:0 "What Kemerskai, nor the decentralized commune of old hadn't been able to accomplish has been, well, just made a reality by comrade Sickleclaw. Uniting the north is just the beginning, though..."
SRS_conscription_reform:0 "Recruitment Policy Reform"

SRS_economic_reform:0 "Socialist Economic Reform"
SRS_economic_reform_desc:0 "We must make an effort to help the ailing people of Vedina and Cloudbury to recover from their barbaric economic policies that favour the privileged classes. Only then we shall expect to compete with the somehow-recovering Empire."
SRS_education_reform:0 "Socialst Education Reform"
SRS_education_reform_desc:0 "The "Harmonic" despots of Vedina have made an effort to keep the people illiterate to keep them in feudal bondage.

SRS_kemerskai_fate:0 "Kemerskai's Fate"
SRS_kemerskai_fate_desc:0 "Traitors always reap what the sow, and Kemerskai is not an exception. The Revolutionary Miliatry Council shall debate on what to do with that rat."
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak:0 "Pacify the Mountains"
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak_desc:0 "In the mountainous north, there is not a richer mountain range than Brantbeak. By taking it, we would deny capitalists resources, and secure our eastern flank from potential Imperial onslaught."

SRS_rejoin_kemerskai_gang_desc:0 "Despite disagreements in the past, Sickleclaw and Kemerskai are, despite unwilling to trust each other at the moment, willing to co-operate against the empire.

SRS_bend_the_knee:0 "Bend the Knee"
SRS_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "We have recieved a list of demands that would humiliate Sickleclaw's government. Some believe it's a consipracy to divide Skynavia, and let Kemerskai pick up the pieces and erase our communist legacy with ease. We're to prove him wrong, of course."
SRS_republican_dream:0 "The Socialist Republican Dream"
SRS_republican_dream_desc:0 "A capitalist Republic can only lead to an oligarchy and fascism, which is the last-ditch effort of the capitalist to prevent the righteous liberation of their capital by the people. Can a honest working griff really call that a dream?"
SRS_moderate_backlash:0 "Moderate Backlash"
SRS_moderate_backlash_desc:0 "The Skynavian moderates, their equivalents - a loud minority in most nations, is the average first-generation settler here. They should be made to know that the deed of allying with the Republican movement is a mere act of pragmatism, and should remain skeptical of the integrity of the Cloudbury Republican Movement, while accepting them as a temproary ally against the resurgent Empire."
SRS_radical_backlash:0 "Radical Backlash"
SRS_radical_backlash_desc:0 "The Skynavian radicals, also called "The Wild Bunch" by their moderate comrades, are expressing their genuine dissapointment in Sickleclaw's government. Sickleclaw must make them know that their protesting is exactly what Kemerskai wanted with his demands."

SRS_congress_two_boogaloo_desc:0 "The first demand from Cloudbury: the formation of the Skynavian Republican Congress, undoing the planned Sickleclaw constitution drafted during the civil war. This was quite possibly meant to cripple Sickleclaw's power as the legitimate leader of Skynavia."
SRS_republican_propaganda:0 ""Republican" Propaganda"
SRS_republican_propaganda_desc:0 "As per the second demand: we are to make our people think that Skynavia will be loyal to the Republican struggle, finish the three decade period of strife in Griffonia. Of course, we can twist the narrative to unite the people, rather than stoke them for the war that will just let Kemerskai exterminate us in the anti-Imperial war to come with deliberately botched engagements."
SRS_together_against_monarchy:0 "Together Against Monarchy"
SRS_together_against_monarchy_desc:0 "A dozen privileged griffons of noble birth indulging in debauchery, while a thousand more toil to supply that debauchery is truly a gross sight. But, in capitalism, that is also the reality well-hidden by Kemerskai's propaganda machine. Only socialism will put an end to the double standards of the Republican movement."
SRS_reforge_enthusiasm:0 "Reforge Enthusiasm"

SRS_approach_the_tribes:0 "Approach the Tribes"
SRS_approach_the_tribes_desc:0 "Our march north was depicted as a brutal conquest of a peaceful tribal region by the Cloudburian reactionaries. If we are to gain the support of the people, we should look to peacefully resolve the conflict with the tribesponies."

SRS_meet_with_waifu_desc:0 "After our pony diplomats somehow managed to break the language barrier and negotiated for a cease-fire, it is time for Sickleclaw to personally shake claw and hoof with the leader, Princess Fiana II. It will be a very... interesting encounter to say the least."

SRS_speak_herzlander_desc:0 "The "Speak Herzlander" program is to make Herzlander an universal language understood at an rudimentary level by every citizen, without alienating the native tongues of non-herzlander citizens.

SRS_republican_knights:0 "Republican Knights"

SRS_warplans:0 "Warplans"
SRS_warplans_desc:0 "Our army isn't a collection of ill-standardized militias anymore. It is akin to Sickleclaw's militia brigades before the power-grab - standardized, uniformed and trained.

SRS_monarchists_be_gone:0 "Solidarity with the Vedinian People"
SRS_monarchists_be_gone_desc:0 "The un-educated masses of Vedina don't care who is the tax collector, 'tis the harsh truth.

SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have.

SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"

SRS_libtard_economics:0 "A Market Economy"
SRS_libtard_economics_desc:0 "As we're rejoining the Republican cause, we should strive to improve our economy via the free market. We can't go around making Skynavia a capitalist paradise overnight, though, so a market socialist economy will do just fine."

SRS_fight_imperial_hordes_desc:0 "A mass recruitment propaganda program will take place in the urban centres. Even if we have enough griffons to hold the line, we still need to earn the right to victoriously march in parade through liberated Griffenheim."
SRS_pistol_makin_colt:0 "The Pistol Makin' Colt"
SRS_pistol_makin_colt_desc:0 "We are in a desperate need for an increase of war material production... And so, a question arises - How old must a creature be to engage in an undertaking to aid the defense of their country? The answer is sixteen, for now at least."
SRS_rifle_makin_mare:0 "Rifle Makin' Mare"
SRS_rifle_makin_mare_desc:0 "While the tribesponies are impossible to be convinced that the Imperials will be more than glad to torch Everfrost, they can still be requested to work in arms factories until the war is over. No creature is immune to propaganda, and our previous undertaking has proven to be successful."
SRS_shell_makin_griff:0 "Shell Makin' Griff"
SRS_shell_makin_griff_desc:0 "Everygriff that had suffered a severe limb or wing injury has an option to continue fighting or not. It should not be a surprise that most prefer to not cast the die again. But, in order to boost our military industrial output, we shall have these wounded former soldiers to take up jobs. They shall be hailed as heroes - even if unwilling to fight after mutilation, they still contribute to the country's defense."
SRS_true_revolutionaries:0 "The True Revolutionaries"
SRS_true_revolutionaries_desc:0 "The Imperials shall tremble when they witness our drive to defend our nation with our lives, to the point of near-suicidal last-ditch attacks. This might lead to decreased recruitment numbers, for dying, no matter how glorified it will be, is not everycreature's cup of tea."
SRS_order_4414:0 "Order 4414"
SRS_order_4414_desc:0 "Not one step back! Retreating from a conquerable Imperial force, while knowing well the Imperial scum will raze yours and your comrades' livelihoods to the ground both is and will be portrayed as the most vile act a creature can commit. This "Order 4414" might be a source of capitalist propaganda against us, but Sickleclaw's being portrayed as a mare blood drinking maarite already, so it's no big deal."
SRS_on_ne_passe_pas:0 "Ils Ne Passeront Pas!"
SRS_on_ne_passe_pas_desc:0 "Remember the Pridean Commune and it's demise. Our Aquileian comrades remember it well, and the phrase "Ils Ne Passeront Pas!", their warcry, will be universally adopted amongst every single creature serving in the armed forces, along with their hardy tactics. This might result in a sharp drop in recruitment numbers, but as if like we had room for those cowards in the field anyway."
SRS_victory_is_ours:0 "Victory Is Ours!"
SRS_victory_is_ours_desc:0 "Comrade Sickleclaw saw us flying the "Stripe-spangled Banner" from a city in a mere frozen tundra, and now we're flying the same flag from the Imperial palace in Griffenheim.

SRS_victory:0 "Victory!"
SRS_victory_desc:0 "The triband is flying over Griffenheim once again, and we should all be grateful for Sickleclaw and his actions: unifying the north almost single-clawedly and rejoined the cause.

SRS_herzland_conquered:0 "The Liberation of Herzland"
SRS_herzland_conquered_desc:0 "It is time to engage in the reconsctruction of Griffonian society as a whole.

The miniscule amount of griffons still doubting in Sickleclaw now have no reason to, for he is the one who brought us here."
SRS_revenge:0 "Revenge"
SRS_revenge_desc:0 "All the Imperial war criminals, both from this war and the counter-revolution that promted the march north, are to be tried and executed. Not in public, though, for Sickleclaw deems this act barbaric."
SRS_herzland_nobility_punishment:0 "The End of the Nobility"
SRS_herzland_nobility_punishment_desc:0 "The appendix of griffon society is finally about to be brought to the end it richly deserved. Just like in Vedina, the scum will be tried. If they come out as benevolent nobles like Gerlach of Feathisia, they get stripped of their titles and get freed, we'll let Boreas sort out the vile part of the nobility..."
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment:0 "The Reformation of the Clergy"
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment_desc:0 "We can't just get rid of the clergy without inciting an uprising. Therefore, we will reform it. Eros, Erion and Proteus will be replaced by more... loyal religious citizens."

SRS_serf_emancipation:0 "The Proclamation of Serf Emancipation"
SRS_serf_emancipation_desc:0 "The serfs of old now own the land they toiled on for generations, and not the vile noble who demanded rent on top of the regular Imperial tax. The countryside will grow to be more acceptable to our rule over time."
SRS_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
SRS_land_redistribution_desc:0 "The land previously owned by private entrepeneurs of noble and... disloyal citizens of monetarily privileged birth will be collectivized. No exceptions, if one puts up resistance, torch it all on fire."

SRS_gulag_industrialists:0 "Punish the Industrialists"
SRS_gulag_industrialists_desc:0 "As much as it hurts to say this, the former industrialists will be treated in the same way the former nobility is. The worst get the noose as the decent try to reform themselves in a brave new world under our watchful eyes."
SRS_protecc_the_worker:0 "Protect the Worker"
SRS_protecc_the_worker_desc:0 "The average worker up north in New Skynavia has a more comfortable work enviroment than the average Herzlander worker. The aforementioned Herzlander worker will get to know work, with zero risk of losing wings to machinery."
SRS_unite_griffonkind:0 "Unite Griffonkind"
SRS_unite_griffonkind_desc:0 "Our job isn't done yet. We cannot sit in Griffenheim while half of Griffonkind is under oppressive regimes. Sickleclaw will lead us through the hardships of war once again, for a brighter future, where everygriff is free to pursue their dream."

SRS_all_is_well_desc:0 ""If you want something done right, do it yourself!" - That was essentially Sickleclaw's life motto. Now that he had done what would be botched under the General Congress, maybe it's time to enjoy the fruits of his labour, like a true worker should."
SRS_lessons_of_the_civil_war:0 "Lessons of the Civil War"
SRS_lessons_of_the_civil_war_desc: "The militias had their first taste of fighting against a modern opponent in years. Experience gained during the civil war will be used to bring the revolution to Vedina and Cloudbury, and possibly Griffenheim itself."

SRS_cleanse_the_army:0 "Cleanse the Army"
SRS_cleanse_the_army_desc:0 "Hundreds of pro-congress civil war veterans were welcomed into the militias.

SRS_loyalty_of_the_generals:0 "Loyalty of the Generals"
SRS_loyalty_of_the_generals_desc:0 "All militia generals are to be evaluated for their potential collaboration with the revanchanists. No stone shall be left unturned in our search for those who joined to commit treason put of spite for comrade Sickleclaw."

SRS_rebuild_thechain_of_command_desc:0 "The civil war's aftermath was a rather chaotic period in Skynavian military history. Absurdities like the Dinkau brigade being led by a battalion commander must be remedied if we are to export the revolution."
SRS_mobile_infantry:0 "Mobile Infantry"
SRS_mobile_infantry_desc:0 "Rather than be strong in numbers, the bulk of our force could be spread thinly with a very fast mobile force to counter spearheads. In case of breakthrough, they'd be the first ones riding straight into enemy lines."
SRS_modern_warfare:0 "Modern Warfare"
SRS_modern_warfare_desc:0 "Motor vehicles, like trucks, are widely adaptable to military use, and don't require heavy and expensive armour plating like tanks. This could be expolited in order to create what is essentially an army on wheels."
SRS_develop_an_armor_corps:0 "Develop an Armor Corps"
SRS_develop_an_armor_corps_desc:0 "It is well known that Skynavia attracted many experts from all fields of science persecuted for their beliefs in socialism, and our land is rich in resources. If we put our back into it, we can make a Skynavian armoured vehicle industry a real thing."
SRS_Mechanization:0 "Mechanization"
SRS_Mechanization_desc:0 "Sickleclaw is fascinated by tanks. So much so, that he is in the position to give advice for new designs. Just keep him away from the people who advocated for one-creature turrets, for the love of Boreas..."

SRS_field_medicine_desc:0 "Charging into combat knowing that even flesh wounds are fatal is not so great for morale. Every soldier shall know how to administer basic first aid, to keep the wounded soldier alive until they reach an aid station."
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier:0 "Every Griffon a Soldier"
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier_desc:0 "We can't be too picky with our recruits, for the strategic-oriented mindset of the high command requires strength in numbers. Our army might lose some prestige, but we really can't manage any other way."
SRS_winter_training:0 "Winter Training"
SRS_winter_training_desc:0 "The Skynavian winter - Only a widow's heart is colder. Luckily, we have a million creatures who are used to it. Their knowledge will be used to help the comrades who live further down south to bear with the cold much better."

SRS_experimental_warfare:0 "Experimental Warfare"
SRS_experimental_warfare_desc:0 "We must improvise - our recruitment pool is too miniscule for a grand strategic-oriented doctrine, and our war machine is too small for mass prodction of vehicles. Instead, we will have our own... amalgamation of a doctrine. We sincerely hope it works."
SRS_specialized_manufacruting:0 "Specialized Manufacturing"
SRS_specialized_manufacruting_desc:0 "Our war machine is too small to be able to afford our equipment breaking, whether on campaign or in combat. From now on, every single bullet made in Skynavia will be a work of art, and every rifle - a masterpiece."
SRS_magical_guns:0 "Magical Guns"
SRS_magical_guns_desc:0 "A bored militagriff somewhere in the Littlegriff mountain range shoved a magic crystal up the barrel in their rifle, loaded a round, and pulled the trigger. Surprisingly, it didn't blow up, instead it fired a magical ray that, upon further investion, can pierce fifteen to twenty milimeters of steel plate. When the bored soul was asked how does it work, he merely answered "Hey, it's magic! I ain't gotta explain shit!""

SRS_military_use_of_radio:0 "Military Use of Radio"
SRS_military_use_of_radio_desc:0 "Wireless communications are the future, and military use of wireless field telephones will bolster interest in further research. Soon enough, Skynavia would become five years in front of Griffenheim for all we know."

SRS_harness_the_power_of_crystals:0 "Harness the Power of Crystals"
SRS_harness_the_power_of_crystals_desc:0 "It is common knowledge that some magic crystals can be used to... forgive my Aquileian, blow shit up. There could be a possibility of a bomb with an undescribable yield, able to wipe out entire cities in one go. Why not be the first one to field a weapon that can destroy the world?"
SRS_rocketry_experiments:0 "Rocketry Experiments"
SRS_rocketry_experiments_desc:0 "Imagine hitting a target anywhere on the face of Griffonia, from Skynavia to, let's say... Kivessin. Horrifying, right?

It quickly became a symbol of the war against the tribes, with many post-bellum film appearences."
