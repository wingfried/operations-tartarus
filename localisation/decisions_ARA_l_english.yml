 ARA_arantigans_abroad:0 "Arantigans Abroad"
 ARA_arantigans_abroad_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Arantigos led his mighty army to conquer all of Griffonia. He died before was able to realise his dream, and his empire collapsed soon after his death. Arantigans have no forgotten their legacy, and we were, and still are, famed for our martial traditions. There are plenty of mercenary companies composed of Arantigans, their descendants or groups of griffons who have not forgotten their heritage and who are willing to return to their ancestral homeland to reclaim its former glory..."
 ARA_last_legion:0 "Hire the Last Legion"
 ARA_last_legion_desc:0 "The so called 'Karthin Legion' claims to be the descended from the armies of the fallen Kingdom of Karthin, conquered by Wingbardians ages ago.

 ARA_call_diaspora:0 "Recall the Diaspora"
 ARA_call_diaspora_desc:0 "Many native Arantigans live abroad in cities like Karthin, Griffenheim, and Manehattan. By organizing propaganda campaigns, perhaps we can encourage some of them to return and help us regain our former greatness..."
